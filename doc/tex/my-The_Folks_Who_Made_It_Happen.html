</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Ten thousand years ago, DVDs were called "campfire stories". Every 
night before sleeping, as the stars wheeled overhead and eyes 
unknown gleamed then vanished out in the darkness, someone sitting 
in the circle would say, "Tell us a tale." Each generation listened 
rapt to their grandparents, reworked the stories, and retold them 
to their grandchildren. When young Walt Disney wrought his 
Snow White, he mined a cultural vein from millennia uncounted. </P><P>Today the folktale is an art largely lost, but open source code 
carries on the folk culture tradition. Such code is folk code, 
reworked by each successive generation until the names are lost 
and only the code itself lives on. </P><P>Mythryl is a rewrite of the SML/NJ compiler which is the work of many, 
many talented hands building on work earlier yet; I know the names 
of but few of these digital storytellers. </P><P>The original <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">ML</SPAN> language was designed and implemented by <B>Robin Milner</B>, 
wellspring from which all subsequent developments flow.</P><P>The seminal <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> document is <I>The Definition of Standard ML</I> by 
<B>Robin Milner</B>, <B>Mads Tofte</B>, <B>Robert Harper</B>, and 
<B>David MacQueen</B>, all of whom have made other major contributions, 
Robert Harper for example going on the head the Fox project at <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">CMU</SPAN> 
to test <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML/NJ</SPAN> as a practical programming language, to pioneer 
mechanical verification of critical <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML/NJ</SPAN> formal properties 
and to supervise a succession of major PhD theses on fundamentals of 
<SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">ML</SPAN> semantics.</P><P>The co-founders of the SML/NJ compiler project were

to being an ace hacker, Leroy is also a leading theoretician who has in particular made major contributions to the

any enjoyment from Mythryl coding, if you ever learn 
anything about programming from using Mythryl, then 
you owe these gentlemen gratitude, a round of applause,

Mythryl would not exist.</P><P>Contributors specifically to Mythryl include (alphabetically):
