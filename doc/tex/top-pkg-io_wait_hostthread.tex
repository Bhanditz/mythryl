The standard library {\tt io\_wait\_hostthread} package implements a server hostthread which 
essentially sits in a loop doing C select() on the currently interesting set of file descriptors, 
pipe descriptors and socket descriptors.  The primary purpose is to offload blocking I/O from 
the main \ahrefloc{pkg:threadkit}{threadkit} hostthread, allowing it to run full speed. 
(A secondary purpose is to generate a timeslicing clock for threadkit via the select() timeout.) 

The {\tt io\_wait\_hostthread} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Io\_Wait\_Hostthread}{Io\_Wait\_Hostthread} api.

The {\tt io\_wait\_hostthread} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/hostthread/io-wait-hostthread.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/hostthread/io-wait-hostthread.pkg}.
