\subsection{Hash Comments}
\cutdef*{subsubsection}
\label{section:ref:comments:hash}

Mythryl supports shell-style comments opened by a {\tt #} character 
and extending to the end of the line.  These are by far the most 
commonly used for of comment in Mythryl.

Unlike in many scripting languages, in Mythryl in order to open a 
comment the opening hash character must be followed by whitespace, 
a second hash character, or an exclamation point,  The latter to 
support {\it shebang} script invocation via a {\tt #!/usr/bin/mythryl} 
line at the top of a script:

\begin{verbatim}
    this is code;         # This is a comment.
    this is code;         ## This is a comment.
    this is code;         #! This is a comment.
\end{verbatim}

\cutend*

\subsection{C-style Comments}
\cutdef*{subsubsection}
\label{section:ref:comments:c}

Mythryl supports C-style comments for comments which 
need to end before the next newline or run more than 
one line.  Unlike C comments, Mythryl comments will 
nest:

\begin{verbatim}
    this is /* A comment: */ code;

    /*
      This is a comment.
     */

    /*
     * This is a comment.   /* This is a nested comment. */
     */
\end{verbatim}

In practice this style comment is seldom used.
