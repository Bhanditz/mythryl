The standard library {\tt univariate\_sample} package implements a simple interface to 
functionality providing for computation of  
mean, variance, standard deviation, skew and kurtosis of a distribution defined by 
a user-supplied function.

The {\tt univariate\_sample} package API is defined anonymously inline in the source.

The {\tt univariate\_sample} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/univariate-sample.pkg}{src/lib/src/univariate-sample.pkg}.
