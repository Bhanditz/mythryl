The standard library {\tt Lazy} api defines access to functionality for delaying 
and resuming computations.  This functionality is used by the Mythryl compiler support 
for lazy computation.

The {\tt Lazy} api is diffusely implemented by a combination of inlined assembly 
support pulled together in the core 
(\ahrefloc{src/lib/core/init/core.pkg}{src/lib/core/init/core.pkg}) and then proxied 
by the package \ahrefloc{pkg:lazy}{lazy}.

The {\tt Lazy} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/nj/lazy.api}{src/lib/std/src/nj/lazy.api}.
