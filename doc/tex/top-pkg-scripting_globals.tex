The standard library {\tt scripting\_globals} package defines a set of convenience functions 
which are available without package qualification in Mythryl scripts.  
Many are inspired by {\tt Perl}; the 
intent is to make writing short scripts in Mythryl more pleasant and productive.

To avoid 
namespace clutter, these are not exported into the vanilla Mythryl program 
environment.  They may still be accessed as {\tt makelib::scripting\_globals::chdir} 
or such, or you may do {\tt include package   makelib::scripting\_globals;} to import 
them wholesale.

The {\tt scripting\_globals} package is defined anonymously in 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/core/internal/makelib.api}{src/lib/core/internal/makelib.api}.

The {\tt scripting\_globals} package source code is in 
 \ahrefloc{src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg}{src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg} 
and gets exported into the global scripting environment by 
 \ahrefloc{src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryld-executable.pkg}{src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryld-executable.pkg}.
