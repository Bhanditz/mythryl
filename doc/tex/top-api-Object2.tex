The standard library {\tt Object2} api defines the interface to the root class of objects with 
equality.  This is temporary development scaffolding.

The {\tt Object2} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:object2}{object2} package.

The {\tt Object2} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/object2.api}{src/lib/src/object2.api}.
