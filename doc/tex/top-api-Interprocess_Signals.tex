The standard library {\tt Interprocess\_Signals} api defines access to the runtime signals facility,
which enables Mythryl-level handling of both POSIX interprocess signnals like SIGALRM and also 
internally generated signals for monitoring (for example) garbage collection.

The {\tt Interprocess\_Signals} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:interprocess\_signals}{interprocess\_signals} package.

The {\tt Interprocess\_Signals} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/nj/interprocess-signals.api}{src/lib/std/src/nj/interprocess-signals.api}.
