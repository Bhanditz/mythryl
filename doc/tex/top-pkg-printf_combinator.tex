The standard library {\tt printf\_combinator} package implements to text formatting 
modelled on C's {\tt printf()}.  This library was written in 2002 by Matthias Blume; 
the design is inspired by Olivier Danvy's "Functional Prettyprinting" work.

This library provides an alternative to \ahrefloc{pkg:sfprintf}{sfprintf}, on which 

the \ahrefloc{pkg:scripting\_globals}{scripting\_globals} {\tt printf} function is based.

The {\tt printf\_combinator} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Printf\_Combinator}{Printf\_Combinator} API.

The {\tt printf\_combinator} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/printf-combinator.pkg}{src/lib/src/printf-combinator.pkg}.
