The standard library {\tt Disassembler\_Intel32} api defines access to disassembly of intel32 object code 
from machine language to assembly language form, primarily in service of inspection of object 
code and executable files produced by the Mythryl compiler.

The {\tt Disassembler\_Intel32} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:disassembler\_intel32}{intel32\_} package.

The {\tt Intel32\_Disassembler} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/disassembler-intel32.api}{src/lib/src/disassembler-intel32.api}.
