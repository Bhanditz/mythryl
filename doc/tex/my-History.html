<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc3593">16.1.6</A>  History</H3><P>
<A NAME="section:compiler:history"></A></P><P>The Mythryl codebase contains a lot of historical 
artifacts, so some familiarity with its history is 
helpful in understanding the code.</P><P>Mythryl is a fork of the SML/NJ [4] codebase. SML/NJ 
was the first compiler for SML, and remains the de 
facto standard reference SML compiler.</P><P>To understand its signficance, some of the history of 
the SML language must be given as context:</P><P>The original ML language was defined in the late 
1970s by Robin Milner as a metalanguage (hence "ML") 
for the Edinburgh logical framework LF.</P><P>The SML/NJ compiler was written in cooperation between 
Bell Labs and Princeton. It began about 1985 as primarily 
a two-person effort between David MacQueen and Andrew Appel, 
with MacQueen serving as language expert and Appel as compiler 
expert. A long succession of PhD students also contributed, 
and in fact continue to contribute.</P><P>Appel is a fan of Fate-Passing Style, and author 
of a series of books on compiler implementation using it. 
(Since he was chief architect of the compiler, these books 
provide useful insight into the SML/NJ design and 
implementation philosophy. [8]) Consquently, the initial 
SML/NJ compiler consisted of a front end from which the 
current front end is directly descended, and a FPS-based 
backend with handcrafted code generator.</P><P>In 1990, Standard ML was defined by the publication of The 
Definition of Standard ML by Robin Milner, Mads Tofte, 
Robert Harper and David MacQueen. In particular, this 
incorporated MacQueen&#X2019;s module system design [6], a huge step 
forward whose repercussions are still being felt. This 
slim volume was the first to formally define not only the 
syntax for a practical programming language, but also its 
semantics.</P><P>A 1991 snapshot of the five-year-old SML/NJ compiler is 
provided by Appel and MacQueen&#X2019;s "Standard ML of New Jersey".[7]</P><P>Zhong Shao&#X2019;s 1994 Princeton PhD thesis [5] provides a good 
snapshot of the SML/NJ compiler as of that year.</P><P>About 1992, Yale launched a FLINT ("Functional Language 
INTermediate code representation"?) project [1] to improve 
the optimization of functional languages.</P><P>The code developed by this initially separate project was 
later merged into the SML/NJ compiler, providing the 
lambdacode and anormcode form passes which now sit between 
the front end and the original FPS optimizer. Essentially, 
the FLINT-derived code now forms the front half of the 
Mythryl highcode module, while the original FPS optimizer 
forms the back half. The seperate heritage of these two 
parts lives on in the form of a lack of integration, 
coordination and nomenclature between them.</P><P>Stefan Monnier&#X2019;s 2003 thesis [3] describes both the tension 
and the synergy between the FLINT-derived and FPS-based 
parts of the highcode module.</P><P>Also about 1992, the MLRISC project [9] was launched 
to implement an optimizing, portable, retargetable, 
language-neutral back end. A snapshot of this project 
as of 1994 is provided in [10].</P><P>The Definition of Standard ML was updated and republished 
in 1997. The changes were mostly minor, and in fact on 
the whole mostly served to simplify the language by removing 
unproductive elements of the original definition.</P><P>About 2000, MLRISC replaced the original SML/NJ compiler 
backend about, although integration between the new 
backend and the rest of the compiler remains marginal. 
(This part of the compiler is renamed "lowhalf" in the Mythryl 
codebase.)</P><P>Also about 2000, Bell Labs, now renamed Lucent, spun off 
as a separate company, and tanking in the stock market, 
stopped funding development of SML/NJ. As a result, the 
principal contributors were forced to seek new positions, 
and development of the SML/NJ codebase slowed to a glacial 
crawl for the 2000-2005 period, with in fact no new end-user 
releases of the compiler whatever.</P>
