The standard library {\tt Printf\_Combinator} api defines access to text formatting 
modelled on C's {\tt printf()}.  This library was written in 2002 by Matthias Blume; 
the design is inspired by Olivier Danvy's "Functional Prettyprinting" work.

This interface provides an alternative to the  
\ahrefloc{api:Sfprintf}{Sfprintf} API, upon which the 
default global {\tt printf} is based.

The {\tt Printf\_Combinator} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:printf\_combinator}{printf\_combinator} package.

The {\tt Printf\_Combinator} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/printf-combinator.api}{src/lib/src/printf-combinator.api}.
