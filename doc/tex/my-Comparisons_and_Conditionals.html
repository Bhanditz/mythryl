<H3 CLASS="subsection"><A NAME="htoc55">5.2.6</A>  Comparisons and Conditionals</H3><P>Mythryl comparison operators are nearly the same as in C.</P><P>The Mythryl <TT>if</TT> statement is a bit different from that of C. In 
particular, the <TT>if</TT> statement ends with a mandatory matching <TT>fi</TT> keyword. This means that you do not need curly braces around a 
block of conditional code in Mythryl, which makes the code a bit more 
concise:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    #!/usr/bin/mythryl

    a = 10;
    b = 3;

    if   (a == b)  printf "a == b is TRUE.\n";
    else           printf "a == b is FALSE.\n";
    fi;

    if   (a &lt;  b)  printf "a &lt;  b is TRUE.\n";
    elif (a &gt;  b)  printf "a &gt;  b is TRUE.\n";
    elif (a == b)  printf "a == b is TRUE.\n";
    else           printf "a and b are INCOMPARABLE.\n";
    fi;

    if   (not (a &lt;= b))   printf "a &lt;= b is FALSE\n";
    fi;

    if (a &gt;= b)  printf "a &gt;= b is TRUE\n";
    else         printf "a &gt;= b is FALSE\n";
    fi;

    if (a != b)  printf "a != b is TRUE\n";
                 printf "a != b is TRUE\n";
    else
                 printf "a != b is FALSE\n";
                 printf "a != b is FALSE\n";
    fi;
</PRE><P>When run this produces</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    linux$ ./my-script
    a == b is FALSE.
    a &gt;  b is TRUE.
    a &lt;= b is FALSE.
    a &gt;= b is TRUE.
    a != b is TRUE.
    a != b is TRUE.
    linux$
</PRE><P>Mythryl also supports a C-style trinary conditional expression. 
Unlike C, the regular Mythryl <TT>if</TT> statement may also be 
used as a value-yielding expression. (In fact, as we shall see, 
just about every Mythryl statement may be used as a value-yielding 
expression.)</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    #!/usr/bin/mythryl

    a = 10;
    b = 3;

    printf "a == b is %s\n"   (a == b  ?? "TRUE" :: "FALSE");

    printf "a != b is %s\n"   if (a != b) "TRUE"; else "FALSE"; fi;

</PRE><P>When run this produces</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    linux$ ./my-script
    a == b is FALSE
    a != b is TRUE
    linux$
</PRE><P>The final major Mythryl conditional statement is the <TT>case</TT> statement. 
In its simplest form, it may be used much like the C <TT>switch</TT> statement:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    #!/usr/bin/mythryl

    a = 3;

    case a
     1 =&gt; print "I\n";
     2 =&gt; print "II\n";
     3 =&gt; print "III\n";
     4 =&gt; print "IV\n";
     5 =&gt; print "V\n";
     6 =&gt; print "VI\n";
     7 =&gt; print "VII\n";
     8 =&gt; print "VIII\n";
     9 =&gt; print "IX\n";
    10 =&gt; print "X\n";
     _ =&gt; print "Gee, I dunno!\n";
    esac;
</PRE><P>Here the underline serves as a match-anything wildcard. We will have more to 
say about this later. For now, just think of it as an <TT>otherwise</TT> clause.</P><P>When run the above produces

    III
    linux$
</PRE><P>Once again, unlike the C <TT>switch</TT> statement, the Mythryl <TT>case</TT> statement 
may also be used as an expression, for its value:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    #!/usr/bin/mythryl

    a = 3;

    print    case a
             1 =&gt; "I\n";
             2 =&gt; "II\n";
             3 =&gt; "III\n";
             4 =&gt; "IV\n";
             5 =&gt; "V\n";
             6 =&gt; "VI\n";
             7 =&gt; "VII\n";
             8 =&gt; "VIII\n";
             9 =&gt; "IX\n";
            10 =&gt; "X\n";
             _ =&gt; "Gee, I dunno!\n";
            esac;
</PRE><P>This is prettier because now we only have to type the <TT>print</TT> in once.</P><P>When run, the above version produces exactly the same results as the original version:</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    linux$ ./my-script
    III
    linux$
</PRE><P>If you wish to have more than one statement per alternative in the Mythryl 
<TT>case</TT> statement you must enclose them in curly braces. Here is an 
example which combines the previous two examples: It both prints a 
value within the <TT>case</TT> statement and also returns a value. (The 
last statement in a curly-brace code block is the value of that block.)</P><PRE CLASS="verbatim">    #!/usr/bin/mythryl

    a = 3;

    print    case a
             1 =&gt; { print "I\n";             "I\n";             };
             2 =&gt; { print "II\n";            "II\n";            };
