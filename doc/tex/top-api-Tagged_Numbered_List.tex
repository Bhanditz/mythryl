The standard library {\tt Tagged\_Numbered\_List} api defines access to datastructures 
which support efficient insertion, deletion and access to items by ordinal number and 
also by abstract tag.  The motivating example is the emacs text buffer, which supports 
both insertion or deletion of the {\it n}-th line and also insertion or deletion at 
the spot marked by a tag.  The intention is to develop a simple, purely-applicative 
analogue of the emacs text buffer.

The {\tt Tagged\_Numbered\_List} api is implemented by the 
{\tt tagged\_numbered\_list} package from 
{\tt src/lib/src/tagged-numbered-list.pkg} 
which is a proxy for the 
{\tt red\_black\_tagged\_numbered\_list} package from 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/src/red-black-tagged-numbered-list.pkg}{src/lib/src/red-black-tagged-numbered-list.pkg}.

The {\tt Tagged\_Numbered\_List} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/tagged-numbered-list.api}{src/lib/src/tagged-numbered-list.api}.
