<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc17">2.2</A>  Place on the Purity Spectrum.</H2><P>The <I>functional programming</I> community is centrally concerned with 
side effects, and in particular avoiding side effects, because expressions 
without side effects obey the fundamental rule that &#X201C;equals may be substituted 
for equals&#X201D; upon which much algebraic reasoning is based. Languages or 
portions of a program which obey this rule should be that much easier 
to understand, reason about and modify. Code which uses no side effects 
is termed <I>pure</I>; other code is termed <I>impure</I>.</P><P>The impure end of the programming language spectrum is anchored by 
older languages like Pascal, C and Lisp which side-effects in almost 
every statement. In general every field of every C record is writable 
and likely to actually get written from time to time. Such languages are 
often termed <TT>imperative</TT>; minimizing use of side-effects was not a 
goal in their design. (In part because they were designed in an era of 
small machines and small programs; taming the complexity of million-line 
programs was not an issue back then.)</P><P>The pure end of the programming language spectrum is anchored by pure-functional 
languages such as Haskell which completely forbid the use of side-effects, or 
at any rate side-effects as we know them. This complete freedom from side-effects 
yields some benefits such as the ability to write fully lazy code. However, having 
to completely avoid use of algorithms which depend upon side-effects is a major 
constraint upon the programmer; for many problems the best known algorithms require 
the use of side effects. Simon Peyton-Jones refers to programming under this strict 
constraint as <I>"wearing the hair shirt"</I>.</P><P>Mythryl sits at neither end of the purity spectrum, but instead within it, 
closest to the pure end. Mythryl does allow the use of side effects, but 
typical Mythryl programs use only about one percent as many side-effects 
as a typical C program. This means that, assuming equal programmer skill, 
Mythryl programs should experience only about one percent as many side-effect 
related bugs (such as race conditions) as an equivalent C++ or Java program.</P>
