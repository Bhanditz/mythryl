<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc10">1.9</A>  Minimal side-effects.</H2><P>In languages like C++ or Java, just about every instruction involves 
a side-effect to the heap.</P><P>This is a problem because in the dawning multi-core, multi-processing 
world, every side-effect to the heap is in fact a broadcast operation 
to all other threads in the address space. This is expensive in hardware 
because cache snooping and cache coherency quickly become critical design 
and performance problems. This is equally expensive in software because 
in the multiprocessing context, every heap side-effect is a bug just waiting 
to happen &#X2014; an open invitation to race conditions and datastructure 
corruption to come roost, costing agonizing weeks of debugging and then 
later showing up in the field anyhow.</P><P>At the other extreme, languages like 
 <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)">Haskell</A> ban heap side-effects completely, at least conceptually.</P><P>This is a problem because for many problems, the best known algorithms 
require side effects. &#X201C;Wearing the hair shirt&#X201D; of complete abstinence 
from heap side-effects can quickly start to feel like an exercise in 
extremism.</P><P>Mythryl occupies a happy medium on the continuum between those two extremes. 
It uses side-effects where, and only where, they are clearly what is logically 
required. The typical C++ or Java program uses side effects about one hundred 
times more frequently than the typical Mythryl program.</P><P>As the number of cores 
per processor proceeds inevitably down the doubling curve from two to four to 
eight and beyond, and as programmers come under increasing pressure to make 
effective use of those cores in their programmers, it is a safe bet that the 
C++ and Java programmers will be spending about one hundred times more hours 
debugging race condition bugs. Not because they are stupider or less careful, 
just because their languages force them to take more risks.</P>
