\section{Preface}

Library reference material is currently sketchy in the extreme, 
partly because the libraries themselves need a great deal of work, 
and it would be inefficient to put a lot of work into documenting 
before they attain stable form.  In many cases your best bet is 
currently looking at the API definitions, or failing that the actual 
source.
