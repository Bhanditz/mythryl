{\sc NB:} {\tt fprintf}, {\tt fnprintf}, {\tt printf}, and {\tt sprintf} are not explicitly listed here because they 
are in fact special syntax implemented as derived forms in the Mythryl parser with the help 
of the \ahrefloc{src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/printf-format-string-to-raw-syntax.pkg}{src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/printf-format-string-to-raw-syntax.pkg} module, 
which expands them into calls to the 
{\tt fprintf$'$}, 
{\tt fnprintf$'$}, 
{\tt printf$'$}, and 
{\tt sprintf$'$} 
functions documented here.
