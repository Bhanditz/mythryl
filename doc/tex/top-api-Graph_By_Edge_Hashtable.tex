The standard library {\tt Graph\_By\_Edge\_Hashtable} api defines graph representations which use hashtables to yield O(1) tests for existence of an edge in the graph.
At present these are used mainly in the compiler.

The {\tt Graph\_By\_Edge\_Hashtable} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:graph\_by\_edge\_hashtable}{graph\_by\_edge\_hashtable} package.

The {\tt Graph\_By\_Edge\_Hashtable} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/graph-by-edge-hashtable.api}{src/lib/std/src/graph-by-edge-hashtable.api}.
