The standard library {\tt parser\_combinator} package implements parser 
combinators over readers. 
These are modeled after the Haskell 
combinators of Hutton and Meijer.

The main difference is that they 
return a single result, instead of a list of results.  This means that 
"or" is a committed choice; once one branch succeeds, the others will not 
be enabled.

While this is somewhat limiting, for many applications it 
will not be a problem. 
For more substantial parsing problems, one should 
use Mythryl-Yacc and/or Mythryl-Lex.

The {\tt parser\_combinator} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Parser\_Combinator}{Parser\_Combinator} API.

The {\tt parser\_combinator} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/parser-combinator.pkg}{src/lib/src/parser-combinator.pkg}.
