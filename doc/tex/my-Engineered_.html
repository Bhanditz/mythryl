<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc13">1.12</A>  Engineered.</H2><P>In the early days of Fortran, language syntax was described by a bunch of English 
text and handwaving, implemented by ad hoc logic. 
Neither the compiler writers nor users really understood what the compiler 
was supposed to be doing, leading to endless misunderstandings, incompatibilities, 
frustrations, and wasted effort.</P><P>The introduction of phrase structure grammars for specifying programming language 
syntax together with <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">LALR(1)</SPAN> parser theory and practice for implementing them 
changed all that: Ad hoc hacking and guesswork were replaced by engineered 
precision establishing a clear distinction between bugs and features.</P><P>But these are still the bad old days when it comes to mainstream language semantics. 
Language syntax is precisely described, but when it comes to what that syntax means, 
the discussion reverts to English text and handwaving, with the inevitable consequence 
of endless misunderstandings, incompatabilities, frustrations, and wasted time. </P><P>At the semantic level, contemporary mainstream languages were not actually designed; rather, 
a grab-bag of cool-sounding features was thrown in a pot and the compiler 
writer asked to somehow make them sorta work together.</P><P>In general, unsurprisingly, this turned out to be impossible.</P><P>For example, in both <CODE>C++</CODE> and Java the typechecking problem turned out 
to be provably undecidable, meaning that it is mathematically impossible 
to produce compilers for those languages which accept all valid programs and 
reject all invalid ones.</P><P>That makes such languages weak foundations upon which to build production 
software systems; if you cannot trust your compiler, where does that leave you? </P><P>The semantics of <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN>, by contrast, was rigorously engineered from the 
start. It is specified not by mumbling and handwaving, but by a mathematically 
precise definition. Based on that definition, properties like typechecking 
decidability were mathematically proven. (The original 1990s proofs were 
checked manually. Today those properties have mechanically verified proofs, 
courtesy of much work at CMU by Robert Harper and a stream of doctoral students.)</P><P>Consequently, <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> may reasonably be regarded as the first fully modern 
programming language &#X2014; the first programming language precision engineered 
rather than just hacked together based on guesses, hopes and prayers.</P><P>Mythryl inherits that clean semantic structure from <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> and adds to it 
various refinements irrelevant to a lab prototype but critical to production 
use.</P><P>Mythryl may thus reasonably be termed the first production software engineering language.</P><P>(An extended discussion of this point may be found
