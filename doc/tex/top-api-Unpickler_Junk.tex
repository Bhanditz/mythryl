The compiler {\tt Unpickler\_Junk} api defines access to functionality for 
deserializing compile unit datastructures from diskfiles, reconstructing 
the original in-memory datastructures.  This is used to implement loading 
of {\tt .compiled} object files in the Mythryl equilent of unix {\tt .o} file 
linking.

The {\tt Unpickler\_Junk} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:unpickler\_junk}{unpickler\_junk} package.

The {\tt Unpickler\_Junk} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/compiler/front/semantic/pickle/unpickler-junk.api}{src/lib/compiler/front/semantic/pickle/unpickler-junk.api}.
