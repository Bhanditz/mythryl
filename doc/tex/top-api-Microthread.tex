The standard library {\tt Microthread} api defines basic thread functionality for multithreaded Mythryl programs.
(Mythryl threads are lightweight userspace constructs not to be confused with posix threads, which are 
uniformly termed ``hostthreads'' in Mythryl documents.)

The {\tt Microthread} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:microthread}{microthread} package.

The {\tt Microthread} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/microthread.api}{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/microthread.api}.
