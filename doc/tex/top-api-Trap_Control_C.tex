The standard library {\tt Trap\_Control\_C} api defines access to functionality allowing 
a program to convert the posix {\sc INT} signal, typically generated by typing 
control-C at the commandline, into a {\sc CONTROL\_C\_SIGNAL} exception which can then be 
handled by the program using normal Mythryl exception handling facilities.

The {\tt Trap\_Control\_C} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:trap\_control\_c}{trap\_control\_c} package.

The {\tt Trap\_Control\_C} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/trap-control-c.pkg}{src/lib/std/trap-control-c.pkg}.
