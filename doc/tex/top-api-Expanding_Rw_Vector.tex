The standard library {\tt Expanding\_Rw\_Vector} api defines access to vectors which 
spontaneously expand as needed to contain requested slots.

The {\tt Expanding\_Rw\_Vector} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:expanding\_rw\_vector}{expanding\_rw\_vector} package.

Additional implementations of the {\tt Expanding\_Rw\_Vector} api 
may be generated using  
{\tt expanding\_rw\_vector\_g} 
from 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector-g.pkg}{src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector-g.pkg}.

The {\tt Expanding\_Rw\_Vector} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector.api}{src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector.api}.
