The standard library {\tt string\_chartype} package implements 
C-style predicates on characters in strings.  This is modelled after the Unix C libraries.  
Each predicate comes in two forms; one that works on integers, and one 
that works on an arbitrary character in a string.  The meanings of these 
predicates are documented in Section 3 of the Unix manual. 

The {\tt string\_chartype} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:String\_Chartype}{String\_Chartype} API.

The {\tt string\_chartype} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/string-chartype.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/string-chartype.pkg}.

See also: \ahrefloc{api:Int\_Chartype}{Int\_Chartype}.
