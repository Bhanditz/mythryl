The standard library {\tt Union\_Find} api defines access to implementations of the 
{\tt union/find} algorithm, which performs disjoint set unions and find operations 
in linear time.    For algorithmic background, see \ahref{\unionfind}{wikipedia union/find}.

The {\tt Union\_Find} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:simple\_union\_find}{simple\_union\_find} 
and  \ahrefloc{pkg:union\_find}{union\_find} packages.

The {\tt Union\_Find} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/disjoint-sets-with-constant-time-union.api}{src/lib/src/disjoint-sets-with-constant-time-union.api}.
