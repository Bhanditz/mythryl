The standard library {\tt Weak\_Reference} api defines access to ``weak'' references.  These 
are references which are ignored by the garbage collector.

Weak references are useful when, for example, 
one wants to keep an index of the existing members of a given class of values without preventing 
them from being garbage-collected when no longer needed.

The \ahrefloc{api:Finalize}{Finalize} implementation is also built upon the weak pointer facility.

The {\tt Weak\_Reference} api is implemented by the  
\ahrefloc{pkg:weak\_reference}{weak\_reference} package.

The {\tt Weak\_Reference} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/nj/weak-reference.api}{src/lib/std/src/nj/weak-reference.api}.
