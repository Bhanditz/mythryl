The standard library {\tt Numbered\_Set} api defines access to binary tree 
datastructures which both efficiently test keys for membership also allow keys to 
be accessed by sequential number within the ordered keyset.

Implementations of the {\tt Numbered\_Set} api may be generated 
via {\tt red\_black\_numbered\_set\_g} from 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/src/red-black-numbered-set-g.pkg}{src/lib/src/red-black-numbered-set-g.pkg}.

The {\tt Numbered\_Set} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/numbered-list.api}{src/lib/src/numbered-list.api}.
