These packages provide access to facilities defined by the IEEE POSIX 
(Portable Operating Systems Interface) standard.

In practice, that means that they are available on unix-derived 
operating systems like Linux, Mac OS X and the BSDs, but not on 
vanilla Windows variants.  (Add-ons such as 
\urldef{\mingw}{\url}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW} \ahref{\mingw}{MinGW} 
and 
\urldef{\cygwin}{\url}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin} \ahref{\cygwin}{Cygwin} 
may be used to provide POSIX support on Windows.)
