</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The Fortran designers found it necessary to distinguish variables by 
type, primarily so that the compiler could reliably distinguish 
integer and floating point variables in order to (for example) 
implement <CODE>*</CODE> using the appropriate hardware multiply instruction. </P><P>Having a host of state of the art language implementation problems 
on their hands, they understandably enough implemented the simplest, 
most obvious type system capable of satisfying this requirement.</P><P>Unfortunately, succeeding mainstream languages have picked up that 
type system with only minor tweaks.</P><P>The result is a type system 
which is burdemsome to the practicing programmer, 
requiring the program text to be littered everywhere with tedious 
type declarations.</P><P>Worse, the type system is low-level and inflexible, making it hard to 
express necessary things, often forcing programmers to circumvent the 
type system via casts, thus giving up much of the potential code 
quality benefits of strong type checking.</P><P>Starting in the 1970s, a succession of researchers beginning with 
Haskell Curry, Robert Feys, Luis Damas, Robin Milner and Roger Hindley 
have developed a modern class of type systems based on using Prolog-style 
unification to propagate type information through the program (thus 
making explicit type declarations necessary only at compilation unit 
boundaries, allowing much cleaner source code) while also introducing 
type functions and variables which allow the programmer much greater 
freedom expression.</P><P>It is now possible and increasingly common to write entire pages of 
type code which execute only at compile time, having no runtime 
correlate whatever. This goes under a variety of names such as 
&#X201C;phantom types&#X201D;. In essence, the compiler typechecker is becoming a 
programmable engine which the software developer may use to verify 
selected properties of the software product, replacing test-and-hope 
with check-and-know.</P><P>Type system design and implementation is currently a very active 
area of research.</P><P>Mythryl inherits from <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> a mature, well understood, center of the road 
variant of classic Hindley-Milner typechecking, bringing its advantages from 
the lab to the production software engineering environment.</P>
