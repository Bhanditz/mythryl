<A NAME="section:ref:types:overview"></A></P><P>The Mythryl type system differs from that of older 
languages like C++ and Java in two important ways: </P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<B>Type inference</B>: The Mythryl compiler uses unification-driven 
inference to deduce the types of variables and functions wherever 
possible. Consequently it is rarely actually necessary for the 
programmer to explicitly specify types outside of API declarations. 
This dramatically improves code compactness and readability.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><B>Parametric Type Polymorphism</B>: Many functions and sumtypes 
do not actually care about the types of some of their arguments.<P>Older languages nevertheless require them to be declared with 
specific types, limiting re-use of such functions and sumtypes.</P><P>Mythryl&#X2019;s Hindley-Milner type system not only allows such values 
to be explicitly declared as don&#X2019;t-cares, but can also almost always 
automatically compute a most general type for such functions and 
datastructures, substantially improving re-usability of both 
functions and sumtypes.
</P></LI></UL><P>In C++ and Java it is routine to use type casts to defeat the 
compiler type checker; this is frequently necessary in order 
to work around the limitations of their type systems.</P><P>The enhanced expressiveness of the Mythryl type system means 
it is almost never necessary to defeat the compiler typechecker 
in this way; in fact, the language does not even define a type 
cast operator for doing so. This leads to code which is enormously 
more typesafe, robust and maintainable than similar code written 
in legacy languages. It is routine for C programs to dump core 
when first run after significant maintenance edits; Mythryl 
programs typically run correctly again the first time they 
compile.</P>
