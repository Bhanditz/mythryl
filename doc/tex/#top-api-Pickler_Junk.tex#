The compiler {\tt Pickler\_Junk} api defines access to functionality for ``pickling'' compiled files. 
By ``pickling'' we mean serializing the in-memory datastructure as a bytestream 
and then writing it into a {\tt .compiled} diskfile.  These diskfiles serve the same logical function 
as traditional unix {.o} object-code files, although they use an unrelated file format, one more 
suited to the needs of the Mythryl platform.

The {\tt Pickler\_Stuff} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:pickler\_stuff}{pickler\_stuff} package.

The {\tt Pickler\_Stuff} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/compiler/front/semantic/pickle/pickler-junk.pkg}{src/lib/compiler/front/semantic/pickle/pickler-junk.pkg}.
