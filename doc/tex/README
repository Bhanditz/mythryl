This directory is Grand Central for Mythryl docs.

TeX is the primary source doc format;  HTML docs
are generated from the TeX using the hevea/hacha
conversion tools by doing

    make book

in the root install directory (i.e., ../..).

The root document file is:     book.tex

All .html files are treated as ephemeral and
deleted by 'make clean'.

TeX versions of the Mythryl source files get
autogenerated into the tree rooted under src/.

HTML generated from them winds up as book*.html
files in this directory.

All files with names matching 'tmp-*' are treated
as ephemeral and deleted by 'make clean'.

A TeX file like    tmp-api-Posix.tex
is autogenerated for each toplevel api.

A TeX file like    tmp-pkg-posix.tex
is autogenerated for each toplevel package.

Two hacks are implemented to allow manual annotation
of the autogenerated package and api pages:

1)  If a file like     bot-api-Posix.tex
    or                 bot-pkg-posix.tex
    exists when
		       tmp-api-Posix.tex
    and                tmp-pkg-posix.tex
    are
    autogenerated, then the former is included
    at the bottom of the latter via an autogenerated
    TeX \input{... } line.

2)  If a file like     top-api-Posix.tex
    or                 top-pkg-posix.tex
    exists, it is
    similarly included at the top of the autogenerated
    file.

The bot-* and top-* files are (obviously) not ephemeral
and not deleted by 'make clean'.

A variety of little tweaks are done to improve the
autogenerated documentation.

Most should be obvious from cursory inspection of the autogenerated
.tex and .html files.

For the rest, if you need to understand them, you will want to read
the relevant Perl scripts in ../../sh/ or perhaps run them with added
'print' statements to elucidate what their operation.
