Mythryl is not just a bag of features like most programming languages;<BR>
It has a design with provably good properties.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>Many readers have been baffled by this statement. This is 
understandable enough; like the first biologists examining a platypus 
and pronouncing it a fake, the typical contemporary programmer has 
never before encountered an engineered progamming language and is 
inclined to doubt that such a thing truly exists, that one is 
technically possible, or indeed what it might even mean to engineer a 
programming language. Could designing a programming language possibly 
involve anything beyond sketching a set of features in English and 
telling compilers writers to go forth and implement? If so, what? </P><P>My goal in this section is to show that it is not only meaningful 
but in fact both possible and worthwhile to truly <I>engineer</I> 
a programming language. </P><P>Every engineering discipline was once an art done by seat of 
the pants intuition.</P><P>The earliest bridges were likely just trees felled across streams. If 
the log looked strong enough to bear the load, good enough. If not, 
somebody got wet. Big deal. </P><P>Over time bridges got bigger and more ambitious and the cost of 
failure correspondingly larger. Everyone has seen the film of 
Galloping Gertie, the Tacoma Narrows bridge, being shaken apart by a 
wind-excited resonant vibration. The longest suspension bridges today have 
central spans of up to two kilometers; nobody would dream of building 
them based on nothing more than "looks strong enough to me". </P><P>We&#X2019;ve all seen films of early airplanes disintegrating on their 
first take-off attempt. This was a direct consequence of 
seat of the pants design in the absence of any established 
engineering framework. </P><P>The true contribution of the Wright brothers was not that they built 
the first working airplane, but rather than they laid the foundations 
of modern aeronautical engineering through years of research and 
development. With the appropriate engineering tools in hand, building 
the aircraft itself was a relatively simple exercise. The Wright Flyer 
was the first controllable, workable airplane because the Wright brothers 
did their homework while everyone else was just throwing sticks, cloth 
and wire together and hoping. Sometimes hoping just isn&#X2019;t enough. </P><P>Large commercial aircraft today weigh hundreds of tons and carry 
hundreds of passengers; nobody would dream of building one without 
first conducting thorough engineering analysis to ensure that the 
airframe will withstand the stresses placed upon it. Airplanes no 
longer fall out of the sky due to simple inadequacy of airframe 
design. </P><P>Airplanes do however fall out of the sky due to inadequacy of 
flight software design. Software today is still an art rather 
than an engineering discipline. It ships when it looks "good 
enough". Which means it often is <I>not</I> good enough &#X2014; and 
people die. </P><P>Modern bridges stand up, and modern airplanes stay in the sky, 
because we now have a good understanding of the load bearing 
capacity of materials like steel and aluminum, of their typical 
failure modes, and of how to compute the load bearing capacity 
of engineered structures based upon that understanding. </P><P>If we are to reach the point where airliners full of passengers 
no longer fall out of the sky due to software faults, we need to 
have a similarly thorough understanding of software systems. </P><P>Modern software depends first and foremost on the compiler. What 
steel and concrete are to bridge design, and what aluminum and 
carbon composites are to airframe design, compilers are to software 
design. If we do not understand the load bearing limits of steel 
or aluminum we have no hope of building consistently reliable brdiges or airframes. 
So long as we do not understand what our compilers are doing, we have 
no hope of building consistently reliable software systems, and people 
will continue to die every year due to simple, preventable software 
faults in everything from radiological control software to flight 
control software to nuclear reactor control software to car control 
software. </P><P>Our minimal need is to know what <TT>meaning</TT> a compiler assigns to a 
given program. So long as we have no way of agreeing on the meaning 
of our programs, as software engineers we have lost the battle before 
the first shot is fired. Only when we know the precise semantics 
assigned to a given program by our compiler can we begin to develop 
methodologies to validate required properties of our software 
systems. </P><P>I do not speak here of proving a program "correct". There is no 
engineering analysis which concludes with "and thus the system is 
correct". What we <I>can</I> do is prove particular properties. We can 
prove that a given program will not attempt to read values from 
outside its address space. We can prove that a given program will 
always eventually return to a given abstract state. We can prove that 
a given program will always respond within one hundred milliseconds. 
We can prove that a given program will never enter a diverging 
oscillation. We can prove that a given program will never read from a 
file descriptor before opening it and will always eventually close 
that file descriptor. We can prove that certain outputs will always 
stand in given relationships to corresponding inputs. Given time, 
tools and effort, we can eventually prove enough properties of a 
flight control program to give us reasonable confidence in trusting 
hundreds of lives to it. </P><P>Traditional programming language "design" does not address the question 
of the meaning of the language. In an engineering sense, traditional 
programming languages are not designed at all. A list of reasonable-sounding 
features is outlined in English, and the compiler writer then turned loose 
to try and produce something vaguely corresponding to the text. </P><P>The first great advance on this state of affairs came with Algol 60, 
which for the first time defined clearly and precisely the supported 
syntax of the language. It was then possible for language designers 
and compiler writers to agree on which programs the compiler should 
accept and which it should reject, and to develop tools such as 
<SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">YACC</SPAN> which automate significant parts of the compiler construction 
task, dramatically reducing the software fault frequency in that part 
of the compiler. But we still had no engineering-grade way of 
agreeing on what the programs accepted should actually be expected to 
do when executed. </P><P>The second great advance on this state of affairs came with the 1990 
release of <I>The Definition of Standard ML</I>, which specified formally and 
precisely not only the syntax but also the semantics of a complete usable 
programming language. Specifying the syntax required a hundred phrase 
structure rules spread over ten pages. Specifying the semantics 
required two hundred rules spread over another thirty pages. The 
entire book ran to barely one hundred pages including introduction, 
exposition, core material, appendices and index. </P><P>As with the Wright brother&#X2019;s first airplane, the real accomplishment 
was not the artifact itself, but rather the engineering methodology 
and analysis underlying it. Languages like Java and C++ never had any 
real engineering analysis, and it shows. For example, the 
typechecking problem is for both of those languages <I>undecidable</I>, 
which is mathematical jargon for saying that the type system is so 
broken that it is mathematically impossible to produce an entirely 
correct compiler for either of them. This is not a property one likes 
in a programming language, and it is not one intended by the designers 
of either language; it is a simple consequence of the fact that the 
designed of neither language had available to them an engineering 
methodology up to the task of testing for and eliminating such 
problems. Like the designers of the earliest airplanes, they were 
forced to simply glue stuff together and pray for it to somehow work. </P><P>The actual engineering analysis conducted for SML is only hinted at 
in the Defintion. To gain any real appreciation for it, one must read 
the companion volume <I>Commentary on Standard ML</I>. </P><P>Examples of engineering goals set and met by the designs of SML include: 
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
Each valid program accepted by the language definition (and thus 
eventually compiler) should have a clearly defined meaning. In 
Robin Milner&#X2019;s famous phrase, "Well typed programs can&#X2019;t go wrong." 
No segfaults, no coredumps, no weird clobbered-stack behavior. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Each expression and program must have a uniquely defined type. 
In mathematical terminlogy, the type system should define a unique 
most general <I>principal type</I> to each syntactically valid 
expression and program. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">It must be possible in principle to compute that type. In mathematical 
terminology, the problem of computing the principal type for an expression 
or program must be <I>decidable</I>. This is where Java and C++ fall down. <P>In general it is excruciatingly easy for the typechecking problem to become 
undecidable because one is always stretching the type system to accept as 
many valid expressions as possible. </P><P>Any practical type system must err on 
the side of safety, of rejecting any program which is not provably typesafe, 
and will consequently wind up throwing out some babies with the bathwater, 
rejecting programs which are in fact correct because the type system was 
not sophisticated enough to realize their correctness. One is always trying 
to minimize the number of such spuriously rejected by being just a little 
more accomodating, and in the process creeping ever closer to the precipice 
of undecidability. The job of the programming language type system designer 
is to teeter on the very brink of that precipice without ever actually falling 
over it. </P></LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">It must be possible in practice to compute that type with acceptable efficiency. 
In modern praxis that means using syntax-directed unification-driven analysis 
to compute principal types in time essentially linear in program size. 
(<I>Hindley-Milner-Damas</I> type inference.) </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">There must be a clear <I>phase separation</I> between compile-time and run-time 
semantics &#X2014; in essence, between typechecking and code generation on the one 
hand and runtime execution on the other. Only then is it possible to write 
compilers that generate efficient code, and only then is it possible to give 
strong compile-time guarantees of typesafety. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The type system must be <I>sound</I>: The actual value computed at runtime 
(i.e., specified by the <I>dynamic semantics</I> must always possess the 
type assigned to it by the compiletime typechecker (i.e., <I>static semantics</I>. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The runtime semantics must be <I>complete</I>, assigning a value to every 
program accepted as valid by the compiletime typechecker. 
</LI></UL><P>The design process for SML involved explicitly verifying these properties by 
informal and formal proofs, repeatedly modifying the design as necessary 
until these properties could be proved. This intensive analysis and revision 
process yielded a number of direct and indirect benefits, some obvious, some 
less so: </P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Both the compiletime and runtime semantics of SML are precise and complete. 
there are no direct or indirect conflicting requirements, nor are there overlooked 
corners where the semantics is unspecified. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">This sort of analysis is arduous and lies at the very limits of 
what is possible at the current state of the art. Consequently 
there was a powerful and continuing incentive to keep the language 
design as spare and clean as humanly possible. The original 1990 
design was already very clean; the 1997 revision made it even 
simpler and cleaner by removing features which had since been found 
to be needlessly complex. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The analysis explicitly or implicitly explored all possible interactions 
between the different language parts; each was revised until it interacted 
smoothly with all other parts in all possible contexts. It was this process 
which took an initial bag of features and welded them into a coherent design. 
It is the lack of this process which has left other contemporary languages 
still an uncoordinated bag of features rife with unanticipated corner cases. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The analysis process exposed initially unanticipated design consequences 
and concomitant design choices, allowing explicit consideration of those 
design choices and selection of the most promising choice. Other contemporary 
languages have discovered these design consequences only in the field when the 
size of the installed base prevented a design change. For example it was not 
initially anticipated that every assignment into a Java array would require a 
type check; this unexpected cost will handicap Java forever. The undecidability 
of Java and C++ typechecking are similar unexpected and unpleasant design misfeatures 
discovered too late to be correctable. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The analysis process made clear which language features were semantically clean 
and which introduced pervasive semantic complexities. For example: 
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize"> 
The original Definition handling of equality introduced special cases throughout 
the semantic rules and proofs; more recent research such as the Harper Stone 
semantics for the language have addressed this by finding a simpler, more natural treatment. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The original Definition treatment of type generativity was via an imperative-flavored 
mechanism which proved resistant to analysis; the more recent Harper Stone semantics 
has addressed this via a clean type-theoretic treatment more amenable to analysis. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The original Definition reconciliation of type polymorphism with the imperative features 
of assignment and exceptions proved needlessly complex; the 1997 revision adopted the 
simplified "value restriction" approach now universally adopted in ML-class languages. 
</LI></UL> </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">The analysis process identified problematic areas in which the semantic consequences 
of particular features was not clearly understood; these features were left out of 
the design, forestalling possible unpleasant discoveries later. For example, inclusion 
of higher order functors was postponed pending deeper understanding of them. </LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Conversely, the analysis identified some generalizations of the language as being 
in fact unproblematic, allowing certain language features which initially looked suspect 
to be included in the language, either in the Standard itself or in commmon extensions. 
</LI></UL><P>SML was the first general-purpose realistic programming language to 
enjoy rigorous engineering-grade design analysis of this sort 
comparable to what we routinely do for a proposed bridge or 
airframe. SML/NJ is the reference implementation of SML, constructed 
with the active assistance of the SML language designers. Mythryl 
inherits this theoretical foundation and this codebase, and adapts it 
to production use in the open source tradition. </P><P><B>Further reading</B> </P><P>The definitive work on the SML language is<BR>
