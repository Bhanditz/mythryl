The standard library {\tt int\_binary\_map} package implements maps from 
{\tt Int}s keys to arbitrary value types. This is a pure (side-effect free) 
datastructure.  

The implementation is based on Binary search trees of Bounded 
Balance, similar to Nievergelt & Reingold, SIAM J. Computing 
2 (1), March 1973.  The main advantage of these trees is that 
they keep the size of the tree in the node, giving a constant 
time size operation.

The bounded balance criterion used is simpler than N&R's alpha. 
Simply, one subtree must not have more than `weight' times as 
many elements as the opposite subtree.  Rebalancing is 
guaranteed to reinstate the criterion for weight>2.23, but 
the occasional incorrect behaviour for weight=2 is not 
detrimental to performance.

The {\tt int\_binary\_map} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Map}{Map} API.

The {\tt int\_binary\_map} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/int-binary-map.pkg}{src/lib/src/int-binary-map.pkg}.
