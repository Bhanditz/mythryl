The compiler {\tt Picklehash} api defines access to functionality creating and 
manipulating unique identifiers for compilation units by first serializing  
and then hashing them.  The resulting hash values have a negligible probability 
of colliding, and thus may be used as a short-hand name for that version of 
the complete compilation unit.

The {\tt Picklehash} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:picklehash}{picklehash} package.

The {\tt Picklehash} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/compiler/front/basics/map/picklehash.api}{src/lib/compiler/front/basics/map/picklehash.api}.
