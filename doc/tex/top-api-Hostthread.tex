The standard library {\tt Hostthread} api defines access to runtime functionality allowing 
Mythryl-level access to Posix threads).  Since in 
general multiple kernel threads run on multiple cores on modern multicore chips, this 
potentially provides processing speedups via parallel computation. 

The {\tt Hostthread} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:hostthread}{hostthread} package.

The {\tt Hostthread} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/hostthread.api}{src/lib/std/src/hostthread.api}.
