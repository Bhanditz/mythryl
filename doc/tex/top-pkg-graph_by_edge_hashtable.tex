The standard library {\tt graph\_by\_edge\_hashtable} package implements a graph representation which uses hashtables to yield O(1) tests for existence of an edge in the graph.
At present it is used mainly in the compiler.

The {\tt graph\_by\_edge\_hashtable} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Graph\_By\_Edge\_Hashtable}{Graph\_By\_Edge\_Hashtable} API.

The {\tt graph\_by\_edge\_hashtable} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/graph-by-edge-hashtable.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/graph-by-edge-hashtable.pkg}.
