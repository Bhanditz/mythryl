The compiler {\tt Unparse\_Compiler\_State} api defines access to state dump functionality 
supporting debugging and documentation.

Nomenclature:  We distinguish syntax tree {\tt unparsing}, which attempts to regenerate an approximation 
of original surface-level syntax, from syntax tree {\tt prettyprinting}, which attempts to display 
the syntax tree as a datastructure in its own right, with no direct reference to surface sytnax.

The {\tt Unparse\_Compiler\_State} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:unparse\_compiler\_state}{unparse\_compiler\_state} package.

The {\tt Unparse\_Compiler\_State} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/compiler/front/typer-stuff/symbolmapstack/unparse-compiler-state.api}{src/lib/compiler/front/typer-stuff/symbolmapstack/unparse-compiler-state.api}.
