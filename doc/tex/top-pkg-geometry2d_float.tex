The standard library {\tt geometry2d\_float} package implements a floating-point version of the basic geometry types and operations from \ahrefloc{pkg:geometry2d}{geometry2d} api.

The {\tt geometry2d\_float} package currently lacks a proper separate api definition.

The {\tt geometry2d\_float} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/2d/geometry2d-float.pkg}{src/lib/std/2d/geometry2d-float.pkg}.
