The standard library {\tt random} package implements a decent subtract-with-borrow {\sc (SWB)} pseudo-random 
number generator 
as described in Marsaglia and Zaman, {\it "A New Class of Random Number 
Generators}, {\bf Ann. Applied Prob. 1 (3), 1991, p 462-480}.

The SWB generator is a 31-bit generator with lags 48 and 8. It has period 
$(2^1487 - 2^247)/105$ or about$ 10^445$. In general, these generators are 
excellent. However, they act locally like a lagged Fibonacci generator 
and thus have troubles with the birthday test. Thus, we combine this SWB 
generator with the linear congruential generator $(48271*a)mod (2^31-1)$.

The {\tt random} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Random}{Random} API.

The {\tt random} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/random.pkg}{src/lib/src/random.pkg}.
