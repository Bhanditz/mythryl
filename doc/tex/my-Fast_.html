<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc6">1.5</A>  Fast.</H2><P>A core design goal of the <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> design effort from its inception was 
supporting efficient code generation by maintaining a 
clear formal <EM>phase distinction</EM> between compile-time 
and run-time semantics.</P><P>Turning that intention into actual high-performance compilers required solving a number 
of new problems, which ultimately took a decade and a half, but today state of the art 
<SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML</SPAN> compilers such as 
 <A HREF="http://mlton.org/">MLton</A> produce code fully competitive with C++ and Java.</P><P>Mythryl inherits from <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML/NJ</SPAN> the fruits of this research. Depending upon the specific 
synthetic benchmark, it generates code that will clock in at anywhere from twice as fast to half as fast as 
a C compiler &#X2014; and roughly one hundred times faster than scripting languages like 
Perl, Python or Ruby.</P><P>Despite this, due to being an incremental compiler that generates optimized code 
directly in memory (as opposed to a batch-mode disk-to-disk compiler like gcc), 
Mythryl offers much of the convenience of scripting languages: Short Mythryl 
programs may be run simply by putting a <TT>#!/usr/bin/mythryl</TT> &#X201C;shebang line&#X201D; 
at the top, and small fragments of code may be compiled and executed directly 
in-process.</P>
