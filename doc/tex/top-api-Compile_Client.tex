The compiler {\tt Compile\_Client} api defines access to part of 
the Mythryl compiler infrastructure for distributed program compilation 
via multiple processes, potentially on multiple machines.  This facility 
is a nonfunctional work in progress.

The {\tt Compile\_Client} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:compile\_client}{compile\_client} package.

The {\tt Compile\_Client} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.api}{src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.api}.
