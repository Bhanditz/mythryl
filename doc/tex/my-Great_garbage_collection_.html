<H2 CLASS="section"><A NAME="htoc11">1.10</A>  Great garbage collection.</H2><P>Despite being pioneered by Lisp systems in the 1950s, garbage collection has 
taken a remarkably long time to reach the mainstream; Java was the first C-family 
language to sport it. Scripting languages like Perl, Python and Ruby by and large 
lack it completely or else use rudimentary reference-counting or primitive 
mark-and-sweep garbage collection. C++ programmers are left out almost entirely.</P><P>This is a pity, because garbage collection is critically important to the 
construction of reliable code when working with the complex datastructures 
characteristic of modern programming &#X2014; and because the last half a century 
has seen tremendous progress in the design and implementation of high-performance 
garbage collection subsystems.</P><P>Use of a state of the art multigeneration garbage collector was integral 
to the <SPAN STYLE="font-variant:small-caps">SML/NJ</SPAN> design and implementation effort from its 1990 inception; 
it has gone through repeated re-implementations since then as theory and 
practice advanced.</P><P>Mythryl, happily, inherits the fruits of that effort, allowing the Mythryl 
programmer to dispense with memory management issues and woes in favor of 
more interesting design and implementation issues.</P>
