The standard library {\tt Makelib} api defines access to top-level Mythryl make / compile functionality.

The functions defined in {\tt scripting\_globals} are available unqualified in scripts; 
in non-script code they may be accessed as {\tt makelib::scripting\_globals::foo}. 

The {\tt Makelib} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:makelib}{makelib} package.

The {\tt Makelib} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/core/internal/makelib.api}{src/lib/core/internal/makelib.api}.
