The standard library {\tt Simple\_Rpc} api defines 
a simple facility to 
do remote-procedure-call style interaction between Mythryl threads. (This 
has nothing to do with posix threads, posix interprocess communication 
or computations distributed over the Internet.)

The {\tt Simple\_Rpc} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:simple\_rpc}{simple\_rpc} package.

The {\tt Simple\_Rpc} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/simple-rpc.api}{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/simple-rpc.api}.
