The standard library {\tt hostthread} package implements access to runtime functionality allowing 
Mythryl-level access to  Posix threads.  Since in 
general multiple kernel threads run on multiple cores on modern multicore chips, this 
potentially provides processing speedups via parallel computation. 

The current garbage collector is single-threaded, so linear speedups are not to be expected,
but a speedup of 3X on a six-core machine is achievable.

The {\tt hostthread} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Hostthread}{Hostthread} api.

The {\tt hostthread} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/hostthread.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/hostthread.pkg}.
