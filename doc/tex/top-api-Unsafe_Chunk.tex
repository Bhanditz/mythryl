The standard library {\tt Unsafe\_Chunk} api defines access to various functions 
coercing raw memory pointers to various types.  This provides the equivalent of 
C pointer type casts for low-level code which needs it.  Caveat Hacker!  This 
also allows you to corrupt the heap arbitarily.  Here be monsters.

The {\tt Unsafe\_Chunk} api is implemented by the 
{\tt unsafe\_chunk} package from 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe-chunk.pkg}{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe-chunk.pkg}.

The {\tt Unsafe\_Chunk} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe-chunk.api}{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe-chunk.api}.
