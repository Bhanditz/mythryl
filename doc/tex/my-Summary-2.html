&#X201C;A Real Programmer can write Fortran in any language.&#X201D;<BR><BR>
</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Congratulations! </P><P>You now know enough to be able to write recognizably idiomatic Mythryl in Mythryl, 
and to write useful applications.</P><P>If, after the first sequence of tutorials, we were like music students 
who knew how to keep warm by burning Stradivarius violins, we are now 
like music students who know how to make music with a Stradivarius 
violin &#X2014; by beating time on it with a stick.</P><P>In the next sequence of tutorials, we shall investigate the world of 
possibilities opened up by playing <I>notes</I> on that violin.</P><P>But first, this is an excellent time at which to pause for a little 
learning by doing, consolidating what you have learned so far and 
building some of the cool programming projects that have been brewing 
in the back of your mind.</P>
