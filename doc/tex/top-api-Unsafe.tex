The standard library {\tt Unsafe} api defines access to various datastructures 
and functions which by-pass the usual compiler type-safeness guarantees.  By 
using this api, you can write code just as flaky and core-dump prone as any 
C program!  This functionality is occasionally used in truly time-critical code 
to avoid some runtime checks.

In general the best advice when tempted to use this module is --- don't!

The {\tt Unsafe} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:unsafe}{unsafe} package.

The {\tt Unsafe} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe.api}{src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe.api}.
