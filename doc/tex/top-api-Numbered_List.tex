The standard library {\tt Numbered\_List} api defines access to binary tree 
datastructures which both map keys to values and also allows keys to 
be accessed by sequential number within the ordered keyset.

The {\tt Numbered\_List} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:red\_black\_numbered\_list}{red\_black\_numbered\_list} package.

The {\tt Numbered\_List} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/numbered-list.api}{src/lib/src/numbered-list.api}.
