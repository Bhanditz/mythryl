The standard library {\tt Redirect\_Slow\_Syscalls\_Via\_Support\_Hostthreads} api defines the internal interface 
for doing ``slow'' system calls such as {\tt read()} and {\tt write()} in separate support hostthreads (posix threads) 
instead of in the main Mythryl hostthread.  This ensures that the main Mythryl hostthread is never blocked on a kernel 
call when there is are still user threads which are ready-to-run.  Preventing the main Mythryl hostthread from blocking 
needlessly results in lower-latency applications which seem "faster" to users. 

The {\tt Redirect\_Slow\_Syscalls\_Via\_Support\_Hostthreads} api is implemented by the 
\ahrefloc{pkg:redirect\_slow\_syscalls\_via\_support\_hostthreads}{redirect\_slow\_syscalls\_via\_support\_hostthreads} package. 

The {\tt Redirect\_Slow\_Syscalls\_Via\_Support\_Hostthreads} api source code is in 
\ahrefloc{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/glue/redirect-slow-syscalls-via-support-hostthreads.api}. 

This code implements part of the startup and shutdown sequencing logic coordinated by the 
\ahrefloc{pkg:run\_at}{run\_at} package.
