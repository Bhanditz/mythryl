The standard library {\tt disassembler\_intel32} package implements disassembly of intel32 object code 
from machine language to assembly language form, primarily in service of inspection of object 
code and executable files produced by the Mythryl compiler.  This is currently a nonfunctional 
work in progress.

The {\tt disassembler\_intel32} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Disassembler\_Intel32}{Disassembler\_Intel32} api.

The {\tt disassembler\_intel32} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/disassembler-intel32.pkg}{src/lib/src/disassembler-intel32.pkg}.
