</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Version 2009-08-19-14.01.49.</P><P>Changes relative to previous release:
</P><UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">First-cut OOP support. <TT>class</TT> is now a reserved word.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Added an &#X201C;Experimental Object Oriented Programming Support&#X201D; tutorial to the &#X201C;Full Monte&#X201D; section.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Added a &#X201C;Roll-Your-Own Objected Oriented Programming&#X201D; tutorial to the &#X201C;Delving Deeper&#X201D; section.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Website html pages were previously sequentially numbered; this meant that 
in general each doc revision changed the names of many pages, defeating deep 
linking. Page names are now derived from page titles, making them much more 
stable over time.</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Syntax finalization, including:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
(IMPORTANT!) The list-forming ("cons") operator is now &#X2019;!&#X2019; instead of &#X2019;.&#X2019; &#X2014; the latter will be needed for dot-product soon.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Elimination of a number of reserved words:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>op</TT> is no longer a reserved word. To pass an infix operator as an argument, write <TT>(+)</TT> instead of <TT>(op +)</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>type</TT> is no longer a reserved word.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>generic</TT> is no longer a reserved word. Write <TT>generic package foo ...</TT> instead of <TT>generic foo ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>generic_api</TT> is no longer a reserved word. Write <TT>generic api Foo ...</TT> instead of <TT>generic_api Foo ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>rec</TT> is no longer a reserved word. Write <TT>recursive my ...</TT> instead of <TT>val rec ...</TT>. (NB: <TT>recursive</TT> is not a reserved word.)
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>raise</TT> is no longer a reserved word. Write <TT>raise exception FOO ...</TT> instead of <TT>raise FOO ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>infix</TT> is no longer a reserved word. To declare an operator infix use <TT>infix my ...</TT> instead of <TT>infix ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>infixr</TT> is no longer a reserved word. To declare an operator right-associative infix use <TT>infixr my ...</TT> instead of <TT>infixr ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>nonfix</TT> is no longer a reserved word. To declare an operator non-infix use <TT>nonfix my ...</TT> instead of <TT>nonfix ...</TT>.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>overload</TT> is no longer a reserved word. Syntax to declare an overloaded opeerator now looks like:
<PRE CLASS="verbatim">    overloaded my + :   ((X, X) -&gt; X)
        =
        ( tagged_int::(+),
          one_word_int::(+),
          two_word_int::(+),
          intgr::(+),
          tagged_unt::(+),
          strcat,
          one_word_unt::(+),
          two_word_unt::(+),
          flt64::(+),
          unt08plus
        );

</PRE></LI></UL>
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Support for incremental addition of functions to overloaded operators. Just use &#X2019;+=&#X2019; instead of &#X2019;=&#X2019; in above syntax.
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Improved support for conventional vector/matrix notation:
<UL CLASS="itemize"><LI CLASS="li-itemize">
<TT>matrix[i,j]</TT> is now supported. (<TT>vector[i]</TT> was already supported.)
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize"><TT>matrix[i,j] := ... </TT> and <TT>vector[i] := ... </TT> are now supported.
</LI></UL>
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Fixed various documentation bugs pointed out by Aurelien and Phil Rand &#X2014; thanks!
</LI><LI CLASS="li-itemize">Incorporated a portability bugfix contributed by Pippijn van Steenhoven &#X2014; thanks!
</LI></UL><P>We now have thirty-one alphabetic reserved words:
</P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="quotation">
<TT>also and api as case class elif else end eqtype esac except 
exception fi for fprintf fun herein if include my or package printf 
sharing sprintf stipulate then where with withtype</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
This is a small enough set to be reasonably easily learned. Few of 
them are common nouns or verbs likely to be wanted by application programmers 
as identifiers: the main offenders are <TT>api, case, class, end, exception, package</TT> and <TT>val</TT>, 
and none of them are easily dispensed with. (I considered using "class package" 
instead of "class" but just could not warm up to it. We might eventually demote 
<TT>class</TT> to being a #DEFINE that expands to <TT>class package</TT>.)</P><P>The reserved word <TT>eqtype</TT> ise obsolescent and should be phased out 
eventually, but I wouldn&#X2019;t hold my breath.</P><P>The reserved words <TT>fprintf</TT>, 
<TT>printf</TT> and <TT>sprintf</TT> should ideally be vanilla library functions, 
but they need special parser support not yet available in generic form to 
library functions, so I wouldn&#X2019;t hold my breath on that either.</P><P>The reserved words <TT>my</TT> and <TT>val</TT> are exactly synonymous. The 
<TT>my</TT> form is shorter when used alone; the <TT>val</TT> form reads better 
when preceded by modifiers.</P><P>The reserved words <TT>class</TT> and <TT>package</TT> were synonymous for 
awhile, but the compiler does now cue on the difference between them 
to avoid scanning all packages for OOP constructs.</P><P>Thus, we might concievably eventually reduce the alphabetic reserved 
word count to perhaps thirty; we are unlikely to get below that. I do 
not anticipate us adding reserved words in the foreseeable future; 
adding non-reserved modifiers to existing reserved words should 
satisfy our evolutionary needs. (This is inspired by Larry Wall&#X2019;s 
focus on Perl evolvability by design, although the Mythryl 
approach is quite a bit different.)</P>
