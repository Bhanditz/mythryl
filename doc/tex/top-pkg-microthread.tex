The standard library {\tt microthread} package implements basic thread functionality for multithreaded Mythryl programs.
(Mythryl threads are lightweight userspace constructs not to be confused with posix threads, which are 
uniformly termed ``hostthreads'' in Mythryl documents.)

The {\tt microthread} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Microthread}{Microthread} api.

The {\tt microthread} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/microthread.pkg}{src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/microthread.pkg}.
