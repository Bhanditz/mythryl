The standard library {\tt Regular\_Expression\_Matcher} api defines access to regular expression matching 
over strings.

For historical reasons Mythryl has far more regular expression APIs and implementations than 
can really be justified, but this is the main one.

Implementations of the {\tt Regular\_Expression\_Matcher} api may be generated via 
{\tt regular\_expression\_matcher\_g} from \ahrefloc{src/lib/regex/glue/regular-expression-matcher-g.pkg}{src/lib/regex/glue/regular-expression-matcher-g.pkg}.

The library-standard implementation of the {\tt Regular\_Expression} api is 
provided by \ahrefloc{pkg:regex}{regex}, which implements Perl-style regular expression matching.

The {\tt Regular\_Expression\_Matcher} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/lib/regex/glue/regular-expression-matcher.api}{src/lib/regex/glue/regular-expression-matcher.api}.
