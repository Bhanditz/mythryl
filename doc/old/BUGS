    bin/mythryld: Fatal error -- bad rw_vector tag 25, chunk = 0x4650003c, desc = 0x69702f65
    MYTHRYL_ROOT=`pwd` sh/make-compiler-executable

Error did not repeat upon just re-issuing the above 'make compiler',
nor after
    make cleanest
    make etags
    make c-stuff
    make compiler

Compile was done on maw, which has ECC, and was rebooted a couple of weeks ago,
so memory bit-errors are not too likely.  (maw doesn't have ecc on the memory
bus, however, so it is not ruled out.)
