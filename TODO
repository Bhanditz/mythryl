In 
    src/c/heapcleaner/make-package-literals-via-bytecode-interpreter.c
figure out why we seem to be segfaulting now and then,
and why the obvious try to fix it results in us segfaulting
every single time -- see comments at top.

Change 
     src/compiler/typechecker/print/prettyprint-utilities.pkg
   lit/put
to
   out/put
and then re/create a 'lit' that just stuffs characters out uninterpreted.
We'll need this for prettyprinting quoted strings containing \n &tc.

After that, change 
   src/lib/prettyprint/src/prettyprint-stream-fn.pkg
to set box widths to 60 or so.


==========================================================================
Code like
    {
        "abc";
        "def";
    }
should trip a compiler warning that the first statement has no effect.
