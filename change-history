2014-05-31-22.22.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/gui/issue-unique-look-id.pkg: Created, used to give look-imp ids a uil::Id type disjoint from the plain Id type, to reduce the change of repeat bugs like the previous.
2014-05-31-21.07.14: src/lib/src/issue-unique-id-wrapper-g.pkg:  New package.
2014-05-31-20.34.51: src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg, src/lib/src/issue-unique-id-g.pkg:  Had   next_id =  result + 1;   where   next_id :=  result + 1;   was needed.  *BLUSH*!  src/lib/x-kit/widget/gui/gui-boss-imp.pkg:  Had   look_to_gui.id   where   gui_to_look.id  was needed: This is a result of insufficient typesafety in the design.
