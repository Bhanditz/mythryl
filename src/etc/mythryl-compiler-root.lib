#
# This is the root of the entire to-be-compiled
# world so far as make_compiler () in
#
#     src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-g.pkg
#
# is concerned.
#
# make_compiler finds us via the
#
#     src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-configuration.pkg
#
# entry
#
#     mythryl_compiler_root_library_filename   = "$ROOT/src/etc/mythryl-compiler-root.lib"
#
#
# When make_compiler invokes make_compile() in
#
#     src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-g.pkg
#
# we get located via
#
#     		mythryl_compiler_root_library_filename   = mcc::mythryl_compiler_root_library_filename;
#
# and we're off to the races.
