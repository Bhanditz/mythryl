# ogl-client-for-library-in-main-process.pkg
#
# This file implements the Mythryl side
# of the Mythryl <-> C interface
# layer for the Mythryl Ogl-in-main-process
# Ogl binding.  The C side is implemented by
#
#     src/glu/ogl/c/mythryl-ogl-library-in-main-process.c
#
# Our alternative Ogl-in-subprocess implementation is in
#
#     src/glu/ogl/src/ogl-client-for-library-in-c-subprocess.pkg
#
# A higher-level easier-to-use wrapper of us is implemented in:
#
#     src/glu/gtk/src/easy-ogl.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
