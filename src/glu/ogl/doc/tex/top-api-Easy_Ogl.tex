The {\tt Easy\_Ogl} api defines access to a high-level {\tt Ogl\_Client} interface 
which emphasizes making easy things easy.

At present this is very much a work in progress.

The {\tt Easy\_Ogl} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:easy\_ogl}{easy\_ogl} package.

The {\tt Easy\_Ogl} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/glu/ogl/src/easy-ogl.api}{src/glu/ogl/src/easy-ogl.api}.
