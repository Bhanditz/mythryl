# This file implements the Mythryl side
# of the Mythryl <-> C interface
# layer for the Mythryl Opencv-in-subprocess
# Opencv binding.  The C side is implemented by
#
#     src/glu/opencv/c/in-sub/mythryl-opencv-library-in-c-subprocess.c
#
# Our alternative Opencv-in-main-process implementation is in
#
#     src/glu/opencv/src/opencv-client-for-library-in-main-process.pkg
#
# A higher-level easier-to-use wrapper of us is implemented in:
#
#     src/glu/gtk/src/easy-opencv.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
