\subsection{Qqq API Calls}
\cutdef*{subsubsection}
\label{section:libref:qqq:qqq-api-calls}

This section summarizes the functions constituting the current Mythryl Qqq 
binding, giving for each the Mythryl type and also (where available) the 
Qqq C function doing the actual work and a link to the Qqq project 
documentation for that function.

For further information see the full API spec: 
\ahrefloc{src/glu/qqq/src/qqq-client.api}{src/glu/qqq/src/qqq-client.api}.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
{\bf Mythryl call} & {\bf C call} & {\bf URL} &  {\bf Type} \\ \hline
% Do not edit this or following lines -- they are autobuilt.  (patchname="api_calls")
negate\_boolean &  &  & (Session, Bool) -> Bool \\ \hline
negate\_float &  &  & (Session, Float) -> Float \\ \hline
negate\_int &  &  & (Session, Int) -> Int \\ \hline
print\_hello\_world &  &  & Session -> Void \\ \hline
% Do not edit this or preceding lines -- they are autobuilt.

\subsection{Qqq Call to Mythryl Binding}
\cutdef*{subsubsection}
\label{section:libref:qqq:qqq-call-to-mythryl-binding}

This section is intended primarily for people who already know the C Qqq function 
names and need to find the Mythryl binding equivalents.  It contains the same 
information as the table in the preceding section, but sorted by Qqq function name:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
{\bf C call} & {\bf Mythryl call} & {\bf URL} &  {\bf Type} \\ \hline
% Do not edit this or following lines -- they are autobuilt.  (patchname="binding_calls")
% Do not edit this or preceding lines -- they are autobuilt.
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Qqq Binding Internals}
\cutdef*{subsubsection}
\label{section:libref:qqq:qqq-binding-internals}

(This section is mainly intended for maintainers working on the Mythryl Qqq binding,
not applications programmers interested only in using it.)

To reduce the bug count and improve ease of maintenance, as much as practical 
of the {\tt Qqq} binding is mechanically generated from compact specifications. 

The generating Mythryl script is {\tt src/glu/qqq/sh/make-qqq-glue}. 

The specification file is {\tt src/glu/qqq/etc/construction.plan}. 

The {\tt make-qqq-glue} script may be invoked 
by doing {\tt make qqq-glue} at the top level.
