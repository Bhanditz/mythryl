This directory contains an x-kit implementation of Luc Cardelli's
BadBricks program (originally implemented in Modula-3).

One way to run this app from the base-directory commandline is:
    linux% my
    eval: make "src/lib/x-kit/tut/badbricks-game/badbricks-game-app.make6";
    eval: badbricks_game_app::do_it "";

One way to run it from this directory is:
    linux% my
    eval: make "badbricks-game-app.make6";
    eval: badbricks_game_app::do_it "";

Gameplay:

    Select 'Easy' (or whatever) from the 'Game' drop-down menu.

    The displayed wall consists of "good" and "bad" bricks.

    The object of the game is to right-click good bricks and
    left-click bad bricks.

    When all bad bricks have been left-clicked, you win.

    If you left-click a good brick, you lose.

    Red bricks have unknown state.

    When you right-click a red good brick it turns yellow
    and displays 'OK'.

    Grey bricks contain the number of adjacent 'good' bricks.
    The idea of the game is to use this information to deduce
    which red bricks are good and bad.

    When you left-click a red bad brick it turns grey.

To build a spawn_to_disk heap image, use

    brick_apps_export::export ();
