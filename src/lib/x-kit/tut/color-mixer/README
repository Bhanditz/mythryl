This directory contains a simple color mixer implemented by
Tim Griffin (AT&T Bell Labs).  It will die after a while,
because it runs out of color cells.  Once color finalization
is implemented, this shouldn't be a problem.

One way to run this app from the base-directory commandline is:

    linux% my
    eval: make "src/lib/x-kit/tut/color-mixer/color-mixer-app.make6";
    eval: color_mixer_app::do_it ();
