This directory contains three simple, independent fatbits-style pixel editors:

    bitmap_editor
	#
	# Displays a rectangular grid of fat pixels.
	# Sets pixels under the mouse pointer one color if the mouse is dragged with button1 down;
	# sets them the opposite color if it is dragged with button2 down;
	# flips pixels under the mouse pointer if it is dragged with any other button down.


    bitmap_widget
	#
	# Displays a rectangular grid of fat pixels.
	# Each pixel is displayed in one of two given colors.
	# set_pixel may be used to set the state (color) of any given pixel.

    pixmap_widget
	#
	# This package appears nearly identical to bitmap_editor;
	# I'm not sure what the critical difference is supposed
	# to be, if any.  It may be just old crud.



The first two of the packages, at least, really should have corresponding

    bitmap-editor-app.pkg
    bitmap-widget-app.pkg

files to demo them, with selfcheck() entrypoint exercised by 'make check'.    XXX BUGGO FIXME.

(If these widgets are actually usable and useful, they should presumably
be moved into the main widgets library... ?)
