This directory contains a silly demo that allows the user to
create and destroy bouncing heads.  Mouse button-1 creates
a new head, button-2 will kill the heads(s) that are pointed
at by the cursor, typing "x" will quit the application.
Mouse button-3 pops up a simple menu.

This demo provides a working example of using the mailcaster
facility to send mail to multiple recipients (the heads), in
particular to a runtime-varying collection of recipients.

One way to run this app from the base-directory commandline is:

    linux% my
    eval: make "src/lib/x-kit/tut/bouncing-heads/bouncing-heads-app.make6";
    eval: bouncing_heads_app::do_it ();
