# Our cross-platform drawing language for the Mythryl widget set.
#
# Draw_Op is intended to be the cross-platform-portable
# subset of windowsystem_to_xserver::x::Op								# windowsystem_to_xserver	is from   src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/windowsystem-to-xserver.pkg
#
# The intent is that guiboss_to_windowsystem should define a
# rendering model which is highly compatible with X
# (Mythryl's prime target) but able to be supported
# with reasonable effort on other platforms.
