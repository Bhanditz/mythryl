Spaces implement the physics for a GUI window or pane:

 o  Whether widgets are allowed to overlap
 o  How widgets are laid out
 o  How widgets move, if they are allowed to.

A space may be as simple as a canvas that just allows
anything to be placed anywhere, or as complex as a
pinball space that implements momentum, friction and
collision detection.
