## xevent-to-gui-event.pkg
#
# windowsystem_imp_for_x implements the boundary between the	# 
# portable and windowsystem-specific parts of the system:
# Higher-level bits like guiboss_imp are intended to		# guiboss_imp			is from   src/lib/x-kit/widget/gui/guiboss-imp.pkg
# be platform-agnostic, whereas lower-level stuff like
# xserver_ximp are platform-specific.				# xserver_ximp			is from   src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xserver-ximp.pkg
#
# windowsystem_imp_for_x should probably be in a library which
# hides all the x-specific stuff, so that higher
# levels of the system cannot accidentally wind
# up calling x-specific stuff.  We don't yet do that. 	XXX SUCKO FIXME
