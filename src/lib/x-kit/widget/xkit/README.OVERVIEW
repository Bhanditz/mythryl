This directory is intended to hold everything x-kit specific.

The widgets are intended for the most part to be renderlib-agnostic
and to run equally happily on top of X, OpenGL or other rendering models.

The major exceptions are the Themes, composed of Skins, which are
by design renderlib-specific, and app windows, which handle
renderlib-specific startup/shutdown issues.
