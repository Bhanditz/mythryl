#											# this file where they can recursively refer to each other to their heart's
# We use four representations for a GUI with transition diagram				# content.  Sometimes it is best to just accept the inevitable...

#     Guipith										# The purpose of this is to allow client code to morph Guipane(s) by generating a Guipith (Gadget_To_Guiboss.get_guipith), editing it, and submitting it (Gadget_To_Guiboss.morph_guipane).
#
# The application programmers passes guiboss_imp a Guiplan
# to define the GUI, which is then converted to a Paused_Gui
# and at GUI startup time to a Guipane.
#
# In addition to defining the three GUI representations, this
# file defines most (but not all) of the major ports between
# guiboss_imp and other imps:								# "gadget" refers to any of "widget", "sprite" or "object".  (Most frequently, "widget".)
#
#	guiboss_to_gadget								# The general guiboss_imp -> gadget interface, used for forwarding user mouseclicks etc.  Most frequently used guiboss_imp -> widget_imp, but also to sprite_imp and object_imp.
#	gadget_to_guiboss								# The general gadget -> guiboss_imp interface, used for forwarding draw operations  etc.
#	guiboss_to_widgetspace								# The guiboss_imp -> widgetspace_imp, used to manage layout of widgets on windows.
#	guiboss_to_objectspace								# The guiboss_imp -> objectspace_imp, used to manage layout of objects on windows.
#	guiboss_to_spritespace								# The guiboss_imp -> spritespace_imp, used to manage layout of sprites on windows.

#
# The purpose of the Rg_Widget facilities generally and
# of RG_ROW RG_COL RG_GRID specifically is to make simple GUI
# layout problems simple.
#
# In general, complex widget layout issues should be handled by
# writing custom code which lays out widgets (etc) on a object,
# not by cluttering Rg_Widget with special cases.
#
# Trying to make complex things simple will always fail;
# the result will be instead to make simple things complex.
