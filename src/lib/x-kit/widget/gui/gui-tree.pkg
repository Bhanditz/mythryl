## gui-tree.pkg
#
# A gui_plan is an abstract gui specification.  Client
# code constructs a gui_plan to describe a desired gui
# and hands it to gui-boss-imp to run.
#
# When gui_boss::run_gui is called, gui_boss converts
# the gui_plan it is given into a gui_tree tree which
# contains running widget imps and records all runtime-
# relevant information.
#
# When gui_boss::end_gui is called, the runtime gui_tree
# is converted back into a gui_plan which preserves the
# state of the GUI at shutdown time, for possible later
# resumption via gui_boss::run_gui.
