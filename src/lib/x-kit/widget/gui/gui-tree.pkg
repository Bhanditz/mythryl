## gui-tree.pkg
#
# A gui_plan is the most abstract gui representation;
# it holds widget eggs which preserve widget state
# information when the widgets are not running.
#
# When a gui is run, gui_boss converts the gui_plan
# it is given into a gui_seed tree which contains
# running widget imps in place of the widget eggs.
#
# The gui_seed tree in turn is then converted into
# a gui_tree which assigns each widget a specific
# pixel-rectangle on a specific window in which
# to draw itself.
