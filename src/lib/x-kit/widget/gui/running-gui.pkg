## running-gui.pkg
#
# A stopped_gui is an abstract gui specification.  Client
# code constructs a stopped_gui to describe a desired gui
# and hands it to guiboss-imp to run.
#
# When guiboss::restart_gui is called, guiboss converts
# the stopped_gui it is given into a running_gui tree which
# contains running widget imps and records all runtime-
# relevant information.
#
# When guiboss::stop_gui is called, the runtime running_gui
# is converted back into a stopped_gui which preserves the
# state of the GUI at shutdown time, for possible later
# resumption via guiboss::restart_gui.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/xkit-widget.sublib


# NB: To avoid circular package dependencies, in this file
#     we avoid referencing any of the *-imp.pkg files,
#     since (some of) them need to refer to us.  To make
#     this work, we moved the *_Arg types -- which we must
#     reference -- out of the *-imp.pkg files.
