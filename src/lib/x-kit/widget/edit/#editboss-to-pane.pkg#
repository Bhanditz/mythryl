## editboss-to-pane.pkg
#
# Here we define the management port which
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/textpane.pkg
#
# exports to
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/editboss-imp.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/xkit-widget.sublib



stipulate
    include package   threadkit;								# threadkit			is from   src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit.pkg
    #
    package g2d =  geometry2d;									# geometry2d			is from   src/lib/std/2d/geometry2d.pkg
    package l2p =  textpane_to_screenline;							# textpane_to_screenline	is from   src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/textpane-to-screenline.pkg
herein

    # This port is implemented in:
    #
    #     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/textpane.pkg    
    #
    package editboss_to_textpane {
	#
	Editboss_To_Textpane
	  =
	  { textpane_id:			Id,						# Unique id to facilitate storing editboss_to_textpane instances in indexed datastructures like red-black trees.
	    #
	    note__textpane_to_screenline:	l2p::Textpane_To_Screenline -> Void,
	    #
	    note_tag:				Int -> Void
	  };
    };

    # The below is intended as a simpler, more generic replacement
    # for the above, simplifying editboss-imp.pkg while allowing
    # it to support a range of pane/mill combinations without
    # having to know their specifics, rather than being specialized
    # to just textpane/textmill.

    # This port is implemented in:
    #
    #     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/textpane.pkg    
    #
    package editboss_to_pane {
	#
	Editboss_To_Pane
	  =
	  { pane_id:				Id,						# Unique id to facilitate storing editboss_to_pane instances in indexed datastructures like red-black trees.
	    #
	    note_tag:				Int -> Void,					# We use this to maintain a dense 1-N numbering of active panes. These tags are displayed on the modeline and used by "C-x o" (other_pane) in   src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/fundamental-mode.pkg
	    note_crypt:				Crypt -> Void					# This is our generic mechanism for delivering linkup messages to pane instances without editboss needing to know about the relevant types/interfaces. Using Crypt buys us modularity at a small cost in typesafety.
