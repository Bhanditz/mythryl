# In-memory representation for "foo.dot" graph files.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/stdlib.make6

# When we read in "foo.dot" files representing graphs,
# Dot_Graph defines the in-memory representation of them:


api Dot_Graphtree {

    include Traitful_Graphtree;				# Traitful_Graphtree	is from   src/lib/std/graphtree/traitful-graphtree.api

    read_graph:  String -> Traitful_Graph;
};
