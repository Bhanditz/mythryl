	# Heisenbug-hunting assistance.
	# Checks for allocation buffer overrun.  If any word in
	# the tripwire buffer is non-zero, logs buffer contents
	# and exits.

    # These two are used to control from the Mythryl level any extra
    # logging compiled into the C runtime.  Typically this is used when
    # the logging statements would otherwise spam the logfile with
    # gigabytes of unwanted spew.  This is normally used only during
    # debugging -- in a production system these calls will usually do nothing:
    #

    enable_debug_logging:		Void -> Void;				# Set global variable   do_debug_logging   to  TRUE in   src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c

    dump_all:				String -> Void;				# Dump to a file everything dumped by the other dump commands excepting dump_whatever().
    dump_all_but_hugechunks_contents:	String -> Void;				# As above, except does not include output corresponding to dump_hugechunks_contents stuff.
    dump_gen0:				String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of the current Task's heap generation zero (allocation buffer)  -- see src/c/h/heap.h
    dump_gen0s:				String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of all         Task's heap generation zero (allocation buffer)  -- see src/c/h/heap.h
    dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers:		String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of all         Task's heap generation zero  allocation buffer overrun tripwire buffers  -- see src/c/h/heap.h
    dump_gens:				String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of heap generations one to N (max active generation).
    dump_hugechunks_contents:		String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of the hugechunk datastructures. (Currently used only to hold code.)
    dump_hugechunks_summary:		String -> Void;				# Dump to a file a   summary  of the hugechunk datastructures. (Currently used only to hold code.)
    dump_ramlog:			String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of the ramlog circular queue from    src/c/h/runtime-base.h
    dump_task:				String -> Void;				# Dump to a file the contents of the current Task -- see struct task in   src/c/h/runtime-base.h
    dump_whatever:			String -> Void;				# Used for ad hoc debugging;  in standard production codebase does nothing interesting.
	#
	# These dump various Mythryl-heap datastructures to
	# disk in human-readable ascii-text form.
	#
	# The autogenerated filenames look like
	#
	#     gen0dump-00006c5e-b4b1a730-1324722008.430408-0.log	# The filename fields are: processid-pthreadid-secondspartofdate-microsecondspartofdate-serialnumber.
	#     gensdump-00006c5e-b4b1a730-1324722008.454121-1.log
	#
	# The filenames are logged to the the current logfile (if any).	# To set/open a logfile do:   file::set_logger_to (file::LOG_TO_FILE "foo.log");
	# The 'String' arg in each call is the caller, logged for
	# diagnostic purposes.

	# These are partial support for  limited an clumsy but serviceable use
	# of gdb (the GNU debugger) in conjunction with Mythryl scripts.
	# 
	# This is intended mainly for debugging Mythryl library bindings which
	# are segfaulting mysteriously. (At the moment, libmythryl-pthread. :-)
	# 
	# 
	# The idea here is to:
	# 
	#   1) Fire up the Mythryl runtime
	#          mythryl-runtime-intel32
	#      from bin/ or /usr/bin/ under gdb.
	# 
	#   2) Place gdb breakpoints on one or more of
	#      these breakpoint_*() fns.
	# 
	#   3) In the Mythryl test script in question,
	#      insert calls to one or more of
	#          heap_debug::breakpoint_0();
	#          ...
	#          heap_debug::breakpoint_9();
	#      (These invoke the above breakpoint_*() C fns.)
	#      These will allow us to regain control of
	#      execution in gdb when script execution reaches
	#      that point.
	# 
	#   4) Run the Mythryl compiler   mythryld
	#      on the Mythryl test script in question.
	# 
	#   5) Singlestep in gdb through the problematic code, or
	#      set more breakpoints in gdb or whatever.
	#
	# During major debug thrashes it may also pay to add actual C code to
	# one or more of the above functions to interactively display stuff
	# or to call problematic C code to allow convenient single-stepping
	# through it or whatever.
