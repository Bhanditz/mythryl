## runtime-signals.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/src/standard-core.sublib

# These are the two basic interfaces to the run-time system signals support.
# The interface covers the basic signals operations, plus a small collection
# of standard signals that should be portable to non-UNIX systems.

# This package gets extended by:
#     src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-signals.pkg
