## winix-text-file-for-win32--premicrothread.pkg
#
# We combine the low-level platform-specific code in
#
#     src/lib/std/src/win32/winix-text-file-io-driver-for-win32.pkg
#
# with the high-level platform-agnostic code in
#
#     src/lib/std/src/io/winix-text-file-for-os-g.pkg
#
# to produce a complete win32-specific textfile I/O solution.
#
# NB: we should also exported be as 'file' on
# win32 platforms, for use by cross-platform programs.
#
# Compare to:
#
#     src/lib/std/src/posix/winix-data-file-for-posix.pkg
#     src/lib/std/src/win32/winix-data-file-for-win32.pkg
