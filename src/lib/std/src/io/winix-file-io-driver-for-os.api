# The core API exported by the
# platform-dependent layer of our file-I/O stack to the
# platform-independent layer is defined in
#
#    src/lib/std/src/io/file-io-driver-for-os.api
#
# Here we define a version of that API which is
# augmented with platform-specific functions to
# create filereaders and filewriters.

# Compare to:

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/src/standard-core.sublib





# This api is implemented in:

#     src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-binary-filereaders-and-filewriters.pkg
#
# An extended (by addition stdin/stdout/stderr)
# version of this api is implemented in:
