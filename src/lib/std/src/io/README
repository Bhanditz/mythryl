Here we implement the "winix" (windows/posix cross-platform)
file I/O stack for Mythryl.  The two main top-level files here are

    winix-text-file-for-os-g.pkg
    winix-data-file-for-os-g.pkg

These generic packages combine platform-specific drivers
(passed as args to the generic) with platform-agnostic code
in their body to produce complete platform-specific file
I/O implementations.
