# io-wait-pthread.pkg
#
# For general background, see "Overview" comments in    src/lib/std/src/pthread/io-wait-pthread.api
#
# Our basic task here is to atch a set of file descriptors
# (typically pipes or sockets) and when an I/O opportunity
# arrives (almost always data now available to read) call
# a corresponding client-provided closure to take advantage
# of that opportunity.
#
# An I/O opportunity can be one of three things:
#
#   o Input file descriptor now has data available to be read. (The typical case of interest.)
#   o Output file descriptor can now accept a data write.      (Much rarer -- usually we just to a blocking write.) 
#   o Out-of-band-data is available to be read.                (Vanishingly rare in practice.)
#
# So our main datastructure requirement it to be able to map
#   (filedescriptor, action)
# pairs to corresponding client-provided closures ("functions").
#
# Since fds are short integers and actions can be represented
# in two bits, we fold fd+action into a single int which can
# then be used to index a stock red-black tree.

# Note[1]
# Most pthread servers block on their request_queue when not busy,
# and thus can be woken by a simple pth::broadcast_condvar, but
# here we will be spending almost all our time blocked in a select(),
# so that will not work.
#
# Consequently we use a dedicated pipe to wake our server pthread.
# By always including a read of this pipe in our select() we ensureq
# that the server pthread can always we woken just by writing one
# byte to the pipe.
