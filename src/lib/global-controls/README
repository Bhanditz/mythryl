This library is designed to support management of global control flags
in an application.

    The original design and implementation were by Matthias Blume.

Comments:
    The main effect of this stuff is to fill the entire program with
    literally hundreds of global variables, thus eliminating any faintest
    hope of making the compiler thread-safe.  It is essentially a Fortran
    solution.  I hope over time to replace it with a functional-programming
    flavored solution. -- 2011-10-02 CrT
