## threadkit-driver-for-os.api
#
# This is the interface to an OS specific module that glues the various
# OS-specific scheduling operations together (i.e., timeouts, I/O, signals,
# etc...).

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib




# This api defines the argtype for the generics:

#     src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/glue/threadkit-export-function-g.pkg
#     src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/glue/thread-scheduler-control-g.pkg

# This api is implemented by:

api Threadkit_Driver_For_Os {
    #
    start_threadkit_driver:						Void -> Void;				# Called at start-up time. 

    wake_sleeping_threads_and_schedule_fd_io_and_harvest_dead_children: Void -> Void;				# Called at pre-emption points.

    pause:  								Void -> Bool;				# Called when there is nothing else to do.  Returns FALSE if there are no threads blocked on OS conditions.

    stop_threadkit_driver:						Void -> Void;				# Called when the system is shutting down.
