# sdl-via-pipe.pkg
#
# This file implements the Mythryl side
# of the Mythryl <-> C interface
# layer for the Mythryl Sdl-in-subprocess
# Sdl binding.  The C side is implemented by
#
#     src/c/sdl/mythryl-sdl-server.c
#
# Our alternative Sdl-in-main-process implementation is in
#
#     src/lib/src/sdl.pkg
#
# A higher-level easier-to-use wrapper of us is implemented in:
#
#     src/lib/src/easy-sdl.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
