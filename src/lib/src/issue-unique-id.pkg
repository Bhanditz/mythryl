## issue-unique-id.pkg
#
# 2014-04-19 CrT:  This functionality is so central that I've made it available in
#                      src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg
#		   reducing the need for this package and issue_unique_id_g().
#
#		   issue_unique_id_g() is still useful if you want to establish
#		   type-distinct id types for typesafety or because you're
#		   running out of ids on a 32-bit system.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib

package issue_unique_id
    =
    issue_unique_id_g ();		# issue_unique_id_g	is from   src/lib/src/issue-unique-id-g.pkg
