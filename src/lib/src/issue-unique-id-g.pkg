## issue-unique-id-g.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib


# Packages which issue unique ID ints in
# sequence in a microthread-safe fashion.
# 
# We make this a generic so that we can
# have as many independent sequences as
# we want, reducing the risk of running
# out of Ints on a 32-bit machine:

# This generic is used in:
#
#    src/lib/src/issue-unique-id.pkg

generic package issue_unique_id_g ()				# Someday we'll probably want to take a type parameter for the counter/return type.
:		Issue_Unique_Id					# Issue_Unique_Id		is from   src/lib/src/issue-unique-id.api
{
    include threadkit;						# threadkit			is from   src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit.pkg
