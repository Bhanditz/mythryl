## translate-treecode-to-machcode.api --- translate treecodes to a Machcode_Controlflow_Graph.
#
#      "Intuitively, this [api] states that the [package] [exports]
#       a function that can transform a stream of [Treecode] statements
#       into a stream of instructions of the target machine."
#
#                      -- http://www.cs.nyu.edu/leunga/MLRISC/Doc/html/instrsel.html
#
# Treecode is the last machine-independent
# intermediate code representation used in
# the compiler; we translate it to machcode,
# the abstract instruction set of the target
# machine, which in turn will be translated
# into asmcode -- target machine assembly -- or
# execode -- actual absolute binary machine language.

# Compiled by:
