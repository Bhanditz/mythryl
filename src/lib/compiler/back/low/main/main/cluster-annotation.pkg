# This file is a temporary hack that records if the virtual 
# frame pointer is being used for the current cluster compilation.
# 
# useVfp is required for spilling, however, at the current time the
# spill callbacks only take the block annotations and nothing else.
# Therefore the spill routine checks this variable to decide which
# base pointer to use.
#
# Eventually the spill call backs will take a enum indicating the
# source of the annotation, and the cluster annotation will also be
# bundled as an input. But until then ...		XXX BUGGO FIXME
