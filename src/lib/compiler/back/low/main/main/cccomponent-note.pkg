# frame pointer is being used for the current cluster compilation.

# use_virtual_framepointer is required for spilling, however, at the
# current time the spill callbacks only take the block annotations
# and nothing else.  So the spill routine checks this variable to
# decide which base pointer to use.
#
# Eventually the spill callbacks will take an enum indicating the
# source of the annotation, and the cluster annotation will also be
# bundled as an input. But until then ...		XXX BUGGO FIXME
