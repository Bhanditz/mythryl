## late-constant.pkg -- constants unknown until late in the compilation process,
##                      used to specialize lowhalf and the code generators.
#
#     "[The backend lowhalf] allows the client to inject into the
#      instruction stream abstract constants that are resolved only
#      at the end of the compilation phase. These constants can be
#      used wherever an integer literal is expected. Typical usages
#      are stack frame offsets for spill locations which are only
#      known after register allocation, and garbage collection and
#       exception maps which are resolved only when all address
#      calculation has been performed."
