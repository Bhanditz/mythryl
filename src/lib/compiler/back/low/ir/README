This directory contains the main IR used by the lowhalf optimizer.
The IR is mainly concerned with control flow and control dependence.
The IR contains the machcode_controlflow_graph, (post-)dominator tree, control depenence graph,
loop (interval) package, plus other facets.  

This IR is quite different from the cluster uniontype which is used by the basic
lowhalf system.  In any case the cluster and the machcode_controlflow_graph are interconvertible.
