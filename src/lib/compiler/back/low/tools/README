What's In Here
==============

  This directory contains some tools for generating
  LOWHALF modules from architecture descriptions.


Organization
============

  prettyprint/         --- a combinator based pretty printer


  line-number-db/  --- a simple source location mapping utility

  precedence-parser/ --- a very naive precedence parser

  adl-syntax/ --- the abstract syntax tree and associated transformation 
                  routines for ADL, which includes a (hopefully complete) 
                  ast for SML.  ADL is LOWHALF's architecture description language.

  parser/     --- parser and lexer for the same

  match-compiler/ --- a pattern matching compiler library

  rewrite-generator/ --- a separate tool for generating rewriters

  nowhere/  --- the source to 'nowhere', a translator that converts
                 SML with where-clauses into SML code.

  ASDL/      --- some utilities for emitting ASDL definitions.
  
  arch/       --- the source for the ADL -> SML code translator.

  basis.md   --- the standard basis for writing architecture descriptions

  adl.vim    --- vim syntax highlighting file for adl descriptions.
