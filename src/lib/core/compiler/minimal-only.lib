# Compiled by:

# This library exists only for administrative reasons because we
# want to mention "minimal.lib" in "interactive-system.lib"
# (so it gets made during bootstrap compilation), but we can't
# do so because of the name conflict that it would create with
# $ROOT/src/lib/core/compiler.lib.  Therefore, minimal-only.lib does not
# re-export package compiler.
