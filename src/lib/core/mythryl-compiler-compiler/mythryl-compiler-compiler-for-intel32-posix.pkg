# used by end users:

# mythryl_compiler_for_intel32_posix is defined in

#
# On intel32-linux platforms, the statement

#     package mythryl_compiler_compiler_for_this_platform = mythryl_compiler_compiler_for_intel32_posix

#     src/lib/core/mythryl-compiler-compiler/set-mythryl_compiler_compiler_for_this_platform-to-mythryl_compiler_compiler_for_intel32_posix.pkg
#
# gets conditionally included by
#
#     src/lib/core/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-for-this-platform.lib
#
# (invoked by src/etc/make-compiler, which is
#  invoked by a toplevel 'make self')
#
# to make us make_compiler, the default bootstrap compiler.
