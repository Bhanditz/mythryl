LIBRARY_COMPONENTS

	# The following two libraries are here to make sure that
	# pickling does not need to refer to host-compiler-0.lib.
        #
	# This is an extremely *fragile* hack, but it significantly reduces
	# autoloading time for package makelib (as well as the system's
	# memory footprint).
        #
	# The two libraries must be mentioned _first_ in order to take
	# advantage of makelib's implicit priority scheme when it comes
	# to constructing the pickle dictionary for a library.
        #
	# (The rule is that libraries that get mentioned early are
	# being favored.)
