##  make-mythryld-executable.pkg 

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/core/internal/interactive-system.lib

# Here we handle generation of a new compiler "executable"
# heap image, and also start-of-execution of that image, since our
# image generation primitive (lib7::fork_to_disk f) is like fork()
# in that it returns one value in the dumping process and another
# value in the dumped process.
#
# At image generation time (aka "link time") this code builds the boot
# dictionaries, sets default signal handlers, and then dumps a heap.
# When the heap image restarts, the system goes interactive.
# 
# (We do not want to go interactive before dumping the heap because it
# would mean that dictionaries get loaded unnecessarily.)
#
# This code refers directly to package compiler, because by the time it
# gets compiled, Makelib's conditional compilation facility has already
# made sure that package compiler refers to the visible compiler
# for the current architecture.

###             Hmmm...
###             I guess I'd spell 'creat()' with an 'e'."
