The principal file here is cd.grammar.
c.grammar and d.grammar are derived from it via cpp and should not be edited.

For C:
 1. comment out DPARSE.define
 2. /lib/cpp -P cd.grammar > c.grammar

For D:
 1. uncomment DPARSE.define
 2. /lib/cpp -P cd.grammar > d.grammar

Note: "-P" so that don't get control info (e.g. # 218 "cd.grammar").
