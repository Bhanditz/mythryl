# gtk-client-for-library-in-c-subprocess.pkg
#
# This file implements the Mythryl side
# of the Mythryl <-> C interface
# layer for the Mythryl Gtk-in-subprocess
# Gtk binding.  The C side is implemented by
#
#     src/opt/gtk/c/in-sub/mythryl-gtk-library-in-c-subprocess.c
#
# Our alternative Gtk-in-main-process implementation is in
#
#     src/opt/gtk/src/gtk-client-for-library-in-main-process.pkg
#
# A higher-level easier-to-use wrapper of us is implemented in:
#
#     src/opt/gtk/src/easy-gtk.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
