The {\tt Easy\_Gtk} api defines access to a high-level {\tt Gtk} interface 
which emphasizes making easy things easy.

At present this is very much a work in progress.

The {\tt Easy\_Gtk} api is implemented by the \ahrefloc{pkg:easy\_gtk}{easy\_gtk} package.

The {\tt Easy\_Gtk} api source code is in \ahrefloc{src/opt/gtk/src/easy-gtk.api}{src/opt/gtk/src/easy-gtk.api}.

See also:  \ahrefloc{api:Gtk\_Client}{Gtk\_Client}.
