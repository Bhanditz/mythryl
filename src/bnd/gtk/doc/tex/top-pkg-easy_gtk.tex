The {\tt easy\_gtk} package implements a high-level interface to 
{\tt Gtk} with the emphasis on making easy things easy.

At present this is very much a work in progress.

The {\tt easy\_gtk} package implements the \ahrefloc{api:Easy\_Gtk}{Easy\_Gtk} API.

The {\tt easy\_gtk} package source code is in \ahrefloc{src/bnd/gtk/src/easy-gtk.pkg}{src/bnd/gtk/src/easy-gtk.pkg}.

See also:  \ahrefloc{pkg:gtk}{gtk}.
