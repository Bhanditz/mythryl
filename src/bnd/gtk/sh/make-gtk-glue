# To minimize code redundancy and consequent
# reliability and maintenance headaches in
#
#     src/bnd/gtk/c/in-sub/mythryl-gtk-library-in-c-subprocess.c
#
# we synthesize simple repetitive functions
# directly from their
#
#     src/bnd/gtk/src/gtk-client.api
#
# type declarations.
#
# The specifications for these functions and
# related declarations and docs are in
#
#     src/bnd/gtk/etc/library-binding.specification
#
# (See top-of-file comments there.)
#
# We are invoked by doing
# 
#     make gtk-glue
#
# At the top level.  This is not done as part
# of a normal build;  I run it by hand after
# I've updated (say) library-binding.specification
