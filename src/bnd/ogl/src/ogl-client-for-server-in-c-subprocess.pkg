# This file implements the Mythryl side
# of the Mythryl <-> C interface
# layer for the Mythryl Ogl-in-subprocess
# Ogl binding.  The C side is implemented by
#
#     src/bnd/ogl/c/mythryl-ogl-server-in-c-subprocess.c
#
# Our alternative Ogl-in-main-process implementation is in
#
#     src/bnd/ogl/src/ogl-client-for-server-in-main-process.pkg
#
# A higher-level easier-to-use wrapper of us is implemented in:
#
#     src/bnd/gtk/src/easy-ogl.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
