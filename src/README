This directory contains full source for the
compiler, plus various related applications.

My normal development cycle consists of doing
the following sequence of commands in the root
directory (.. -- that containing the INSTALL
file):

    make compiler		# Builds compiler proper.
    make rest			# Builds rest of codebase.
    sudo make install		# Currently compiler must be installed.
    make cheg			# Or just   make check.   The "cheg" target also resynthesizes Gtk-support code.
    make tart			# Or just   make tar.   Both makes a tar.gz backup; the "tart" target also does a "make etags" to generate an emacs TAGS file indexing the codebase, supporting tags-search and tags-query-replace.
