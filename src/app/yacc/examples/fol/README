fol/README

This is a sample parser for first-order logic.   The grammar
was contributed by Frank Pfenning.

The parser is defined by the files

  fol.lex       #  Defines lexer 
  fol.grammar   #  Defines grammar 
  link.pkg	#  Constructs basic parser packages 
  absyn.sml	#  A trivial abstract syntax 
  interface.pkg #  interface to lexer and parser properties 
  parse.pkg	#  Driver functions 
  Makefile.lib #  makelib file 

To compile this example, type

	- makelib::make "Makefile.lib";

in this directory.  Makelib will invoke mythryl-lex and mythryl-yacc to process the
lexer specification fol.lex and the grammar specification fol.grammar
respectively.  Then it will compile the resulting SML source files

  fol.lex.sml
  fol.grammar.sig
  fol.grammar.sml

and the other sml source files.

The end result of loading these files is a package Parse containing
the following top-level driver functions:

  my prog_parse : String -> Absyn.absyn 
   #  parse a program from a string 

  my query_parse : String -> Absyn.absyn
   #  parse a query from a string 

  my file_parse : String -> Absyn.absyn
   #  parse a program in a file 

  my top_parse : Void -> Absyn.absyn
   #  parse a query from the standard input 


The file list.fol is a sample input file that can be parsed using
the file_parse function:

  - Parse.file_parse "list.fol";


NOTE: The Makelib description file Makefile.lib mentions the mythryl-yacc library
(mythryl-yacc-lib.lib). Makelib's search path should be configured so that this
library will be found.  This should normally be the case if Lib7 is
properly installed.
