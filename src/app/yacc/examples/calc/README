This is a sample interactive calculator built using Mythryl-Yacc and Mythryl-Lex.

The calculator is defined by the files

  calc.lex       #  Defines lexer 
  calc.grammar   #  Defines grammar 
  calc.pkg       #  Defines driver function, Calc.parse 
  Makefile.lib #  makelib file 

To compile this example, type

	- makelib::make "Makefile.lib";

in this directory.  Makelib will invoke mythryl-lex and mythryl-yacc to process the
lexer specification calc.lex and the grammar specification calc.grammar
respectively.  Then it will compile the resulting SML source files

  calc.lex.sml
  calc.grammar.sig
  calc.grammar.sml

and the calc.pkg file containing the driver code.

The end result of loading these files is a package Calc containing a
top-level driver function named parse.  

  Calc.parse : Void -> Void

The calculator can be invoked by applying Calc.parse to the Void value.

  - Calc.parse();
  1+3;
  result = 4

The calculator reads a sequence of expressions from the standard input
and prints the value of each expression after reading the expression.
Expressions must be separated by semicolons.  An expression is not
evaluated until the semicolon is encountered.  The calculator
terminates when an end-of-file is encountered. There is no attempt to
fix input errors: a lexical error will cause exception LEX_ERROR to be
raised, while a syntax error will cause PARSE_ERROR to be raised.

NOTE: The Makelib description file Makefile.lib mentions the mythryl-yacc library
(mythryl-yacc-lib.lib). Makelib's search path should be configured so that this
library will be found.  This should normally be the case if Lib7 is
properly installed.
