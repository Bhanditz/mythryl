# To implement the Lib7 "run" construct, we must have
# access to the full definition of the packages (and
# generics) exported from a given source file.
# (Or more precisely, from a compilation unit -- bare_o7 or iced_o7.)
#
# In this file we define the core datastructure used
# to record such definitions.  It is used in the
#
#     src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg
#
# definition of the Oh7_View type, which in turn
# are used to associate this information with Far_O7
# nodes in the inter-library (library-granularity)
# dependency graph.
