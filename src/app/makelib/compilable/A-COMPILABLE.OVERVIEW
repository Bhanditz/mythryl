By a 'compilable' we currently mean a foo.api or foo.pkg file.
More generally, we mean any file containing source code which
can be compiled by the Mythryl compiler -- by and by we might
support foo.lisp files, say.

Code in this directory is concerned with tracking what we
know about the compilables for a given library, such as:

 o What compilables exist.
 o Which compilables have been compiled.
 o Which compilables need recompiling (edited since last compiled).
