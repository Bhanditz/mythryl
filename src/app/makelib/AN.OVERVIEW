OVERVIEW
--------

Makelib implements the user-interaction layer which sits on
top of the compiler proper.  Its main two functions are:

 o  Implement an interactive loop so users can
    type in expressions at the prompt and have
    them instantly compiled, executed, and the
    results displayed.

    The core code for this is the interact() function in
        src/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg

 o  Support programs separate compilation and linking of
    applications which consist of more than one sourcefile.

    The compiler proper deals only with the problem of
    compiling a single source file to produce native code
    in memory plus updated symbol tables.  Everything else
    is our responsibility, including:

     o  Defining and implementing the .compiled objectfile format
        which holds the result of compiling one sourcefile.

     o  Finding the complete set of sourcefiles needed for
        an application.

     o  Finding a topological ordering of that sourcefile set
        which ensures that we don't compile any sourcefile
        until all the sourcefiles upon which it depends have
        already been compiled.  (This is necessary so that
        their exported type information will be available
        to the compiler when needed.)

     o  Compiling all the sourcefiles needed in the required
        order, maintaining the symbol tables appropriately
        to reflect all externally visible information exported
        by each file compiled.

     o  Optionally combining .compiled files into code library
        files if the user so requests.

     o  Loading all required .compiled files into memory in proper
        topological order, executing the top-level code in
        each as soon as it is loaded, and tracking both the
        set of .compiled files loaded and also the values they
        have computed.


STARTUP
-------

When mythryld is run, it begins execution near the bottom of

    src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryld-executable.pkg

picking up where the dump that generated the heap image
left off.

After printing the start-up banner and
processing any command-line options,
main.sml does
     backend::interact::interact ()
to enter the interaction loop.

This invokes the
    src/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loops-g.pkg
function
    fun interact ()
        =
        (   read_eval_print_loop::interact ();
            os::process::exit os::process::success
        )

        which in turn invokes the meatier
            src/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg
        interact() function.

The two major commands invoking Makelib "make" functionality are

    makelib::make    "foobar.lib"
    makelib::compile "foobar.lib"

which promptly land you at the respectively appropriate of the

    src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg

entrypoints

    load
    compile




OPERATION
---------

The operation of Makelib can be understood best by looking at its
central datastructure, the dependency graph.  You can find the
definitions of its associated types in

    src/app/makelib/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg

There is also a dependency graph at the resolution of libraries.
Its definition is in

    src/app/makelib/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg

One can roughly divide Makelib into frontend and backend.  It is the
frontend's responsibility to establish the dependency graph for a
given project.  The backend implements various ways of traversing the
graph, thereby performing the operations that the user expects:
consistency checking, recompilation, linking, library building,
generation of listings or other statistics, etc.

The central component of the frontend is the parser.  It builds the
dependency graph incrementally with help from the dependency analyzer.

* Analysis CAN be performed incrementally because the sub-graphs that
correspond to sub-libraries are independent of how they are being used.

* We DO perform analysis incrementally because the parser occasionally
wants to know what the exported symbols of sub-libraries are.
(This is required for the parser's conditional
compilation facility.)  While it would probably be possible to achieve
this using a more cursory analysis, the extra effort of implementing
it would definitely not be outweighed by any gains.

The dependency analyzer must inspect the source code of the
project.  Within Makelib, handling of source code is centralized -- all
information pertaining to one source file is bundled as an abstract
data type (SmlInfo.info).  You find the definition (and the
implementation) of that type in smlfile/smlinfo.sml.  In particular,
one important optimization that saves many repeated invocations of
the compiler's parser is to strip the abstract syntax tree of all
unnecessary (as far as Makelib is concerned) information and store the
"compressed" version in a cache.  I call such compressed 
syntax information a "module dependencies summary".  You will find
the definition of the module dependencies summary type in
   src/app/makelib/compilable/module-dependencies-summary.pkg
Associated code is in the same directory.

The dependency analyzer operates on module dependencies summaries.
Its implementation can be found in
    src/app/makelib/depend/make-dependency-graph.pkg


PRIVILEGES (access control)
---------------------------

The basic mechanisms for access control are implemented: Makelib can
correctly detect which "privileges" would be required to access sublibraries
and libraries.  However, nothing has been done to actually enforce
anything.  In other words, everybody is assumed to have every possible
privilege.  Makelib merely reports which privileges "would have been
required".  For the time being this is not really critical.
Enforcement must be tied into some form of OS-specific enforcement
mechanism (such as Unix file permissions or something similar), and I
haven't really thought out a way of doing this nicely and cleanly.

The basic idea behind Makelib's "privileges" is quite easy to understand.
In their description files sublibraries and libraries can specify a list of
privileges that the user of such a sublibrary/library must possess in order
to be able to use it.  Privileges at this level are just names
(strings).  If one sublibrary/library imports from another sublibrary/library,
then privileges are being inherited.  In effect, to be able to use a
program, one must have all privileges for all its libraries/sublibrary,
sub-libraries, sub-sub-libraries, etc.

Of course, this is not yet satisfactory because there should also be
the possibility of setting up a "safety wall": a library LSafe.lib
could "wrap" all the unsafe operations in LUnsafe.lib with enough error
checking that they become safe.  Therefore, a user of LSafe.lib should
not also be required to possess the privileges that would be required
if one were to use LUnsafe.lib directly.

To this end, in Makelib's model of privileges it is possible for a
sub/library to "wrap" privileges.  If a privilege P is wrapped, then
the user of the library does not need to have privilege P even though
the library is using another library that requires privilege P.  In
essence, the library acts as a "proxy" who provides the necessary
privilege P to the sub-library.

Of course, not everybody can be allowed to establish a library with
such a "wrapped" privilege P.  The programmer who does that should at
least herself have privilege P (but perhaps better, she should have
"permission to wrap P" -- a stronger requirement).

In Makelib, wrapping a privilege is done by specifying the name of that
privilege within parenthesis.  The wrapping becomes active once the
library gets built (see below).  The (not yet implemented)
enforcement mechanism must ensure that anyone who builds a library
that wraps P has permission to wrap P.


LIBRARY BUILDING
----------------

Aside from the issues concerning privileges, library building is a way of
putting an entire pre-compiled library -- together with its
pre-computed dependency graph -- into one single container.  Once this
is done, Makelib will never need to have access to the original source
code.  Before actually consulting the description file for a library,
the parser will always check and see if there is a library built.
If so, it will suck the dependency graph out of the container and be
done.

Because of the "use" feature, it sometimes is necessary for the
dependency analyzer of a sublibrary to consult the contents (i.e., the
definitions) of apis, packages, or generics that are imported
from sub-libraries.  Since the pre-computed dependency graph does not
contain such information, it will then become necessary to recover it
in a different way.

Remember, the source code shouldn't have to be available at this
point.  However, the same information is contained in the static
environment that is stored in every .compiled file.  (An .compiled file is the
result of compiling one source file. It contains executable code
and a pickled representation of the static environment that is
exported from the compilation unit.)  Aside from the dependency graph,
the container for a built library also stores all the associated
.compiled files.

Loading (stable) .compiled files for the purpose of dependency analysis is
sometimes necessary, but since it is expensive we do it as seldom as
we can (i.e., lazily).  The implementation of this mechanism (which is
really just a hook into the actual implementation provided by
GenericVC) is in depend/se2dae.sml. (See the comments there.)  It is
used in stable/stable-library.sml.  (Look for "cvtMemo"!)

Information pertaining to members of built libraries is managed
by the abstract sumtype BinInfo.info (see stable/bininfo.sml).  In
some sense, BinInfo.info is to build libraries code what SmlInfo.info
is to not-yet-built libraries.

By the way, only libraries can be built.  A built library
will encompass its own sources as well as the sources of sub-libraries
(and their sub-libraries, and so on).  Sub-freezefiles of the library, on
the other hand, will be referred to symbolically (they do not get
"sucked" in like sublibraries do).  In effect, sub-libraries of a library
becomes convenient for resolving name-spacing issues without
compromising the "one single container" paradigm of freezefiles.


DEPENDENCY GRAPH
----------------

The division into THAWED and FROZEN libraries is clearly
visible in the definition of the types that make up dependency graphs.
There are "frozenlib_tome"s for objectfiles that live within freezefiles
(frozen library case) and there are "thawedlib_tome"s for objectfiles
that live in their own independent .compiled files (thawed library case).

You will notice that one can never go from an frozenlib_tome to a thawedlib_tome.
This mirrors our intention that a sub-library of a frozen library must
also be frozen.  From thawedlib_tomes, on the other hand, you can either go
to other thawedlib_tomes or to frozen_compilables.  All the "localimports" of a
thawedlib_tome (i.e., the imports that come from the same library) are
also thawedlib_tome.  To go to an frozenlib_tome one must look into the list of
"globalimport"s.  Global imports refer to "far" nodes -- nodes that
are within other libraries.  The edge that goes to such a node
can have an export filter attached.  Therefore, a far_compiledfile_in_lib is
an frozenlib_tome with an optional filter attached and a far_compiledfile is an compiledfile with an
optional filter attached.

Imports and exports of a library are represented by "import_export"s.
Import_exports are essentially just far_compiledfile nodes, but they also contain
the dependency analyzers "exported package definitions dictionary"
which contains information about the actual definitions (contents)
of exported packages/generics.  As mentioned above, this is needed
to handle the "use" construct of the language.

The exports of a sub/library are then simply represented by a
mapping from exported symbols to corresponding import_exports.
(See depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg.)


RECOMPILATION AND EXECUTION
---------------------------

There is (NOT!) a generic dagwalk routine that is used to implement both
recompilation dagwalks and execution (link-) dagwalks
(compile/generic.sml).  The decision of which kind of dagwalk is
implemented comes from the generic argument: the "compilation type".
An api describing compilation types abstractly is in
compile/compile-type.pkg.  In essence, it provides compilation
environments and associated operations abstractly.

Concrete instantiations of this api are in compile/recomp.sml
and in compile/exec.sml.  As you will see, these are also implemented
as generics parameterized by an abstraction of "persistent state".
Persistent state is used to remember the results of dagwalks from
invocation to invocation of Makelib.  This avoids needless recompilation in
the case of recomp.sml and facilitates sharing of dynamic values in
the case of exec.sml.  (However, the two cases are otherwise quite
dissimilar.)

Persistent state comes in two varieties: "recomp" and "full".  Full
state is actually an extension of recomp state and can also be used
where recomp state is expected.  The "normal" Makelib uses full state
because it implements both recompilation and execution.  The same
state is passed to both ExecFn and RecompFn, so it will be properly
shared by recompilation and execution dagwalks.  In the case of the
bootstrap compiler, however, we never actually execute the code that
comes out of the compiler.  (The code will be executed by the runtime
system when bootstrapping.)  Therefore, for the bootstrap compiler we
don't use full state but simply recomp state.  (If we cross-compile
for a different architecture we could not possibly execute the code
anyway.)
