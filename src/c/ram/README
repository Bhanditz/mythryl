System-dependent code for allocating ram pages from the os.

The API defined in

    src/c/h/get-quire-from-os.h

exports these functions to clients:

    void                         set_up_quire_os_interface   ();
    Quire*        obtain_quire_from_os        (Vunt  bytesize)
    void                         return_quire_to_os          (Quire* region);

There are three different implementations:

 1) A version that uses the SVR4 mmap mechanism to allocate chunks of memory:
	//
	src/c/ram/get-quire-from-mmap.c

 2) A version that uses the MACH vm_allocate call to allocate chunks of memory:
	//
	src/c/ram/get-quire-from-mach.c

 3) A version built for win32:
	//
	src/c/ram/get-quire-from-win32.c


2010-11-16 CrT:
Apparently there was once a fourth implementation:

 4) A version that layers memory chunk management on top of the brk system
    call, which includes an implementation of malloc retrieved from g.oswego.edu:/pub/misc/malloc.c

Only the malloc.c file remains.
